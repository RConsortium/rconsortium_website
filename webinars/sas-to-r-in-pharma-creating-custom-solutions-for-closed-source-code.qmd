title: "SAS to R in Pharma – Creating Custom Solutions for Closed-Source Code"

When supporting a heavily regulated pharmaceutical client in migrating their codebase from SAS to R, ProCogia encountered a complex pipeline built around a proprietary SAS function. The challenge was to develop an R-based solution that not only replicated the original functionality, but also integrated seamlessly with the client’s existing systems.

In this webinar, ProCogia's Gabriel Brock walked through the approach they took to deliver a high-fidelity migration tailored to the client’s specific needs. Brock also highlighted why a structured evaluation process is critical to the success of any SAS-to-R migration effort—especially in high-compliance environments like pharma.
