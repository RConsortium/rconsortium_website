### September 9, 9am PT/12pm ET

When supporting a heavily regulated pharmaceutical client in migrating their codebase from SAS to R, ProCogia encountered a complex pipeline built around a proprietary SAS function. The challenge was to develop an R-based solution that not only replicated the original functionality, but also integrated seamlessly with the client’s existing systems.

In this webinar, we’ll walk through the approach we took to deliver a high-fidelity migration tailored to the client’s specific needs. We’ll also highlight why a structured evaluation process is critical to the success of any SAS-to-R migration effort—especially in high-compliance environments like pharma.
