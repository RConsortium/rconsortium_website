title: "R for Health Technology Assessment (HTA): Identifying Needs, Streamlining Processes, and Building Bridges"

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwCMO9D0mjE >}}

The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) working group within the R Consortium was established last year with the goal of supporting the use of R for HTA across academia, industry and authorities.

One work stream of the working group is mapping out stakeholders, their process and their unmet needs that R can support. In this webinar we will present our initial findings regarding the key unmet needs. We have mapped internal processes on the industry side in creating an (EU) HTA submission and identified automatable streams and critical interfaces between work packages. We will highlight the challenges in the processes, our planned approach for dissecting complexities to create clarity, and suggest next steps, ensuring R support throughout the submission.

At the end we have allocated time for discussion, so please bring your own perspective on using (or not) R in HTA submissions.

This webinar is aimed at everyone in the field of statistics in the world of (EU) HTA. Whether you are an expert in the industry, HTA bodies or academia, this event is for you!
