Historically, scaling up data analysis in R meant adding infrastructure or radically changing analysis strategy - maintaining a database, working on a cluster, or refactoring code for parallel data processing.

The Arrow ecosystem provides an alternative: fast, memory-efficient analysis without the overhead.

This webinar will cover:

- the evolution of the modern data stack
- practical approaches to working with larger datasets in R
- the impact of the Parquet format on data workflows
- how Arrow enables handling of data that doesn't fit in memory
- where tools like DuckDB fit into the picture

We'll look at how to get started, real-world examples, and the design choices that make these tools work well together.
