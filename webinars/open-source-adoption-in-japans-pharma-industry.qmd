## Summary

Join us for a special webinar hosted by R consortium and JPMA to explore the results of the "2024 OSS Usage Status Questionnaire Report." This report captures how pharmaceutical companies in Japan are adopting open-source software — particularly R — and how trends have evolved since our last survey in 2022.

Key highlights include:

* Over 60% of companies have adopted R; 16 have used or plan to use R for regulatory submissions (e.g., FDA, PMDA).

* 25% are actively using pharmaverse packages such as Admiral, rtables, and pkglite.

* More than 80% expressed interest in submitting R Shiny applications, similar to the R Consortium’s Pilot 4.

During the session, JPMA members will walk through the key insights and host a Q&A discussion to address your questions and perspectives.
