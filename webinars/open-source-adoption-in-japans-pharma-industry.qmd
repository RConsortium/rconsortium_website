## Summary

This webinar was hosted by the R consortium featuring speakers from the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) to explore the results of the “2024 OSS Usage Status Questionnaire Report.” 

This report captures how pharmaceutical companies in Japan are adopting open-source software — particularly R — and how trends have evolved since our last survey in 2022.

Key highlights include:

* Over 60% of companies have adopted R; 16 have used or plan to use R for regulatory submissions (e.g., FDA, PMDA).

* 25% are actively using pharmaverse packages such as Admiral, rtables, and pkglite.

* More than 80% expressed interest in submitting R Shiny applications, similar to the R Consortium’s Pilot 4.

During the session, JPMA members will walk through the key insights and host a Q&A discussion to address your questions and perspectives.
