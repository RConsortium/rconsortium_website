### Abstract

Are you new to Git and Github and wondering how to leverage it efficiently in your clinical trial work? Do you hear the terms "CI/CD" and/or "orchestration" and struggle to see the practical benefit in your day-to-day statistical programming work? If yes or you're just curious, then this session is for you\!

Join us as we pull back the curtain on a unique, real-world project where more than 15 programmers from across the pharmaceutical industry united to collaborate effectively using Git and Github. We will share the practical strategies and workflows that made this multi-company effort a success, using the R Consortium Submission pilot5 project as our example.

You'll see firsthand how we leveraged the power of GitHub to review code changes and have discussions in the code\!  We will then explore how the team used  CI/CD and GitHub Actions to maintain a codebase, build an automated QC engine, saving time and reducing manual errors. As a glimpse into the future, we will also reveal how we integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) to handle QC checks that rule-based automation alone can't manage.

Leave this session inspired and equipped to take the next step, understanding how contributing to open-source projects is the perfect way to practice your new skills in a supportive, real-world environment.
