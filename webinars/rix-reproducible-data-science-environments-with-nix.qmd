Reproducibility is critical for modern research, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated and verified. In this one-hour presentation, Bruno Rodrigues introduces Nix, a package manager designed for reproducible builds. 

Unlike other solutions, Nix ensures that R packages, R itself, and system-level dependencies are all correctly versioned. It can even replace containerization tools like Docker, working seamlessly on any operating system and CI/CD platform. 

To help beginners get started, Bruno developed an R package called {rix}, which he  demonstrates.

There is an extensive Q&A session after the presentation and demo.
