The primary mission of the R Consortium is to develop and implement infrastructure projects to support 
the R community. As a Linux Foundation Project, the R Community embraces principles of openness and 
collaboration as defined in the [Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct.qmd).

## Board of Directors

The business of the foundation is managed by its Board of Directors, composed of appointed Platinum 
members of the R Consortium, annually elected Silver members of the R Consortium, and the ISC appointed 
director as [defined in the ByLaws](/rc-docs/R-Consortium-Bylaws-7-9-2024.pdf) (PDF).
