  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daroczig/?originalSubdomain=hu">Gergely Daroczi</a>, organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/budapest-users-of-r-network/">Budapest Users of R Network</a> (BURN), recently spoke with the R Consortium about his efforts to reignite Hungary’s R community after the pandemic. With over 1,800 members, BURN is rebuilding momentum through in-person meetups and lightning talks that reconnect data professionals and R enthusiasts. Gergely also shared how he used R to integrate data from a continuous glucose monitor, dietary logs, and Strava’s API—analyzing real-time health metrics to successfully reverse type 2 diabetes and demonstrate R’s power beyond traditional analytics.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-has-the-group-been-doing-since-we-last-spoke">How has the group been doing since we last spoke?</h2>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how to restart the community after COVID impacted it so heavily. Many other meetup organizers, even those outside of the R community, have shared similar experiences. Some have managed to get back on track fairly well; for instance, I attended a few <a href="https://pydata.org/">PyData</a> conferences and the <a href="https://user2025.r-project.org/">UseR! Conference</a> this year was a great opportunity to connect with others. However, in Budapest, we are still struggling.</p>
<p>To provide some context, the Hungarian R meetup, known as Budapest Users of R Network (or BURN for short), has more than 1,800 members. I recently announced our first event for 2025, but attendance is not looking promising—only about 15 RSVPs so far, which is unusually low. In the past, we typically had between 50 and 80 attendees, regardless of the topic. I believe this decline reflects a general trend of reduced motivation to attend meetups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Meetup platform is also becoming less effective in my opinion. I’ve checked in with several contacts on Slack, LinkedIn, and other platforms, and they said they didn’t receive notifications about the new event announcement. I also tried messaging the entire group via meetup.com, as that’s the only channel I have available, but even those follow-up emails didn’t reach many people. I’ve opened a support ticket with meetup.com, and they have acknowledged the problem, but there is no ETA on a fix and no way to reach our members effectively.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-budapest-users-of-r-network-and-reversing-diabetes-how-gergely-daroczi-brings-data-to-life-with-r/BURNMeetup1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We ended up with 39 RSVPs for our recent <a href="https://www.meetup.com/budapest-users-of-r-network/events/311069930">event in November</a> and 5 different presentations on a variety of topics. One presentation showcased a Shiny application created by a junior data scientist as part of his job application portfolio. Another talk, from a university professor, focused on her work with a static site generator using R to implement her CV and list of publications. And a well-known member of the Hungarian data community shared his insights on the global trends in the R and Python world.</p>
<p>I also contributed by sharing a side project where I used R to track my blood glucose levels, as I’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I’ve been utilizing R to monitor my diet and exercise habits to develop a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>

Have you observed any significant changes during this time?</h2>
<p>I see both favorable and less favorable trends in my experience teaching in the Business Analytics program at Central European University in Vienna. Initially, R was the primary programming language used in the program. We taught R for various applications, including building dashboards, reporting with R Markdown, and even implementing APIs. All courses relied on R.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, two years ago, a decision was made to switch to Python. Although I continue to teach my courses in R, as I’m still convinced it is a better fit for general data analysis, they are now electives. That said, I understand the reasoning behind the shift; there is clearly more demand in the job market for Python users due to its versatility.</p>
<p>On the flip side, R remains incredibly powerful in several industries. For example, in sectors like bioinformatics and banking, R continues to excel. Many outstanding R packages don’t have comparable alternatives in other programming languages. It’s reassuring to see that R remains strong and continues to grow in these fields.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which is a challenging condition. I was informed that I needed to start medication immediately because my glucose levels were extremely high. However, I consulted with another doctor who supported me in making lifestyle changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to adopt a strict low-carb diet to help lower my glucose levels. I also started exercising daily and began using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to get real-time access to my glucose levels. This small device attached to my arm takes measurements every few minutes.</p>
<p>To track my progress, I created some R scripts that pull data points from various sources. I used an Android application to monitor my food intake, and this data is stored on a PHP-written website that unfortunately doesn’t provide an API. As a result, I had to devise creative methods to extract this data. I documented the process in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daroczig_rstats-activity-7334697464173596673-ELun?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAXwvhoB6jbBMHy1BYiiV9iOzSZxdmntXbI">LinkedIn</a> post, detailing how I tracked my caloric and carbohydrate intake throughout the day.</p>
<p>In addition to my food data, I accessed the CGM data on my phone. I installed open-source software that synced all the collected data points to an <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, another open-source database that I set up on one of my servers. I also integrated my old elliptical trainer, which uses a proprietary Android application. Fortunately, I found someone who reverse-engineered the protocol, allowing me to sync that data to <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>. Strava offers a free API, even for its free plan, allowing me to obtain the data and run daily reports.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-budapest-users-of-r-network-and-reversing-diabetes-how-gergely-daroczi-brings-data-to-life-with-r/BURNPRoject1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>These reports help me understand how my glucose levels fluctuate throughout the day, how different foods affect my levels, how I can manage spikes through exercise, and how to structure my day effectively. I’ve received regular feedback on how my body responds, which has been incredibly helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On these charts, the black line represents my actual glucose levels, as measured. The vertical red lines indicate my energy and carb intake, and the gray intervals show the periods when I was exercising on the elliptical trainer.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/reviving-budapest-users-of-r-network-and-reversing-diabetes-how-gergely-daroczi-brings-data-to-life-with-r/BURNProject2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I observed that my glucose levels fluctuated, with occasional spikes that were concerning. My goal was to maintain my glucose levels within the green zone, which represents a healthy range, while keeping them as low as possible when they approached the orange or red zones, indicating unhealthy levels. This feedback was instrumental in helping me attain a healthy state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After four months, I shared an update along with my lab results, which indicated that over the past quarter, I had been 100% healthy, with normal glucose levels. Achieving this required significant changes to my diet, such as reducing carbohydrate intake and committing to regular exercise. I accomplished this without medication, mainly because of the empirical data I collected and the instant feedback it provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this experience was like a data analysis project, aimed at maximizing my health outcomes. I found R to be an invaluable tool for consolidating these data points, enabling me to track and improve my health.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The pharmaceutical industry is currently navigating a significant shift toward open-source programming, with R becoming an increasingly vital tool for regulatory submissions. In a recent R Consortium webinar, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) shared a detailed case study of their successful “Hybrid R/SAS” submission strategy to the FDA.</p>
<p>Presented by Alicia Humphreys, Steven Haesendonckx, and Linshan Yuan, the presentation outlines how J&amp;J leveraged the strengths of both languages to achieve FDA approval, offering a roadmap for other organizations looking to modernize their submission pipelines.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/johnson-and-johnsons-success-story-a-hybrid-r-sas-strategy-for-fda-submission/jnj-submissions-main-image.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="the-hybrid-strategy-best-of-both-worlds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hybrid-strategy-best-of-both-worlds"><strong>The Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds</strong></h3>
<p>Moving entirely to a new language can be daunting. J&amp;J adopted a pragmatic “Hybrid R/SAS” approach to balance innovation with stability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SAS for Data Derivation:</strong> ADaM datasets were created using SAS to leverage existing institutional knowledge.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>R for Analysis and Visualization:</strong> All Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs) were generated using R.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach allowed the team to utilize R’s flexible visualization framework and cutting-edge statistical methods while seamlessly integrating into workflows built around legacy tools.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-proven-success" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-proven-success"><strong>A Proven Success</strong></h3>
<p>The presentation highlighted two major milestones regarding this strategy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Submission 1:</strong> A pilot trial utilizing this hybrid strategy was submitted and approved by the FDA within the designed timeline.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Submission 2:</strong> A second submission is currently ongoing with positive agency response.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="ensure-reproducibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ensure-reproducibility"><strong>Ensure Reproducibility</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles in R submissions is replicating the sponsor’s environment (often Linux-based) on the reviewer’s system (often Windows).</p>
<p>J&amp;J navigated this by adapting the practices used in R consortium pilot submissions. Specifically, in Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) they included a specific Appendix titled “Set-up R environment and Analysis” which guided the reviewer through:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> Using a script to install required packages from CRAN or GitHub.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Locking the Environment:</strong> Creating an <code>renv.lock</code> file <em>after</em> installation to snapshot the ecosystem locally, rather than trying to transport a potentially non-portable lockfile between operating systems.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Scripts were converted to <code>.txt</code> files (e.g., <code>tsidem01-r.txt</code>) to meet eCTD requirements while maintaining traceability.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>R consortium’s Note on eCTD Requirements:</strong> While the J&amp;J team converted scripts to <code>.txt</code> files for their submissions, please note that regulatory standards have recently progressed. As a result of the collaboration between the R Consortium and the FDA, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download?attachment">latest FDA Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (August 2025)</a> now explicitly allows R-related file extensions for electronic submissions. This conversion step is therefore no longer necessary for future eCTD packages.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways-for-the-community"><strong>Key Takeaways for the Community</strong></h3>
<p>The presenters offered several recommendations for future R submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage Open Source Repositories:</strong> Use CRAN or curated repositories to simplify the setup process for reviewers.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Documentation and Communication are the Key:</strong> Update the ADRG with clear instructions on package installation and environment reproduction. J&amp;J used the R Consortium Pilot 3 ADRG as a template. It is always a good idea to communicate with FDA staff early on your submission plan.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Dependencies:</strong> Use standard packages where possible and minimize reliance on complex proprietary packages to reduce friction.</li>
</ul>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The use of R in the pharmaceutical industry has shifted from exploratory research to a robust standard for regulatory submission. In 2025, the China Pharmaceutical R User Group (PharmaRUG) exemplified this transformation, hosting a series of dynamic events that connected local developers with the global R community. As the R Consortium continues to support the worldwide community of users and developers, the China PharmaRUG’s activities this year highlight how open-source collaboration is reshaping clinical reporting,.</p>
<p>Here are three pivotal moments from the China PharmaRUG in 2025 that showcased technical innovation and strategic foresight.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/bridging-gaps-and-breaking-barriers-a-year-of-r-innovation-with-the-china-pharmarug/third-pharmarug-conf.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="the-3rd-pharmarug-conference-innovation-in-hybrid-format-march-2025" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-3rd-pharmarug-conference-innovation-in-hybrid-format-march-2025">1. The 3rd PharmaRUG Conference: Innovation in Hybrid Format (March 2025)</h2>
<p>In March, the community gathered for the 3rd China Pharmaceutical Industry R User Group Meeting. True to the spirit of inclusivity, this was a hybrid event with on-site locations at the Johnson &amp; Johnson campus in Shanghai and the Sanofi campus in Beijing, alongside an online broadcast.</p>
<p>This meeting went beyond standard presentations and focused on overcoming technical hurdles in modern clinical trials. Highlights included:</p>
<p>• AI and R Integration: Speakers from Boehringer Ingelheim demonstrated how to integrate AI coding assistants with R, comparing tools like gptstudio and btw to enhance workflow efficiency.</p>
<p>• Serverless Analysis: Kaiping Yang from BeOne showcased a novel approach using Vue and webR to perform serverless local statistical analysis directly in a browser, proving that R applications can be both lightweight and highly responsive.</p>
<p>• Open Source Education: The event also featured deep dives into package validation and design, such as Daniel Sabanés Bové’s (RCONIS) presentation on rpact and crmPack for designing clinical trials.</p>
<p>The diversity of topics—ranging from AI-generated ADaM datasets to easeP21 for validation—demonstrated that the local community is not just adopting R, but actively pushing the boundaries of what the language can do in a regulated environment.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="global-connection-r-in-pharma-apac-track-november-2025">2. Global Connection: R in Pharma APAC Track (November 2025)</h2>
<p>In November, the PharmaRUG played a crucial role in the R/Pharma 2025 conference by organizing the APAC Track. While the conference was virtually accessible to anyone in the Asia-Pacific time zone, the community emphasized face-to-face connection through local hubs.</p>
<p>The Shanghai gathering, hosted at the Johnson &amp; Johnson office, served as a physical anchor for the virtual track. This event featured keynotes and over 18 regular presentations covering reporting, prediction, and AI. It was a testament to the “multiverse” concept often discussed in the industry—where end-to-end clinical reporting moves away from legacy systems toward a diverse ecosystem of open-source tools. By aligning with the global R/Pharma schedule, the China PharmaRUG ensured that local innovations were shared on a global stage, reinforcing the R Consortium’s mission to foster international collaboration.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-foundations-the-december-4th-gathering">3. Strategic Foundations: The December 4th Gathering</h2>
<p>The year concluded with a targeted small-group gathering on December 4th, focused on high-level strategy and future pilots. While the larger conferences focused on “showing,” this meeting focused on “planning” for the complex regulatory landscape ahead.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from this strategic session included:</p>
<p>• Regulatory Validation: The group discussed the differences between FDA and CDE submission requirements. With data and system requirements tightening, the group recognized the urgent need for robust validation frameworks.</p>
<p>• Synthetic Data Pilot: A major proposal from the meeting was to pilot an end-to-end submission using synthetic data to both the FDA and CDE. This initiative aims to test the waters for future submissions without risking proprietary clinical data.</p>
<p>• AI Governance: As AI tools become more prevalent, the group discussed building error detection systems and scoring models to validate AI outputs, ensuring that the “black box” of AI remains compliant with pharmaceutical standards.</p>
<section id="join-the-movement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="join-the-movement">Join the Movement</h3>
<p>The transition from legacy software to R is well underway, with major players and local biotechs alike embracing the language. The China PharmaRUG is supported by the R Consortium’s RUGS program, which provides grants to help groups organize and share information worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisa-barbanti/?originalSubdomain=ch">Luisa Barbanti</a>, organizer of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-zurich/">R-Ladies Zurich</a>, recently spoke with the R Consortium about building and sustaining a technically focused R community in Switzerland. With a background in biostatistics and professional experience at a data science consultancy, Luisa shared how she utilizes R for data wrangling, statistical modeling, and internal tooling, leveraging Quarto and Shiny. She discussed the evolution of R-Ladies Zurich and highlighted the challenges of maintaining momentum as community members transition through different phases of their careers.</p>

<p>My name is Luisa, and I am based in Zurich because I started my studies here. While studying mathematics, I developed an interest in statistics. I realized that to pursue this field, I needed to learn R, a programming language essential for statistical work. I began to explore R by taking classes and practicing with it.</p>
<p>Zurich has a very active R community, including an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/zurich-r-user-group/">R User Group</a>. Being in this environment where everyone was engaged with R was inspiring. I started attending the R User Group meetings regularly. Eventually, I began a PhD in biostatistics at the University of Zurich, where working with R became a significant part of my daily responsibilities. I had tasks that required creating functions and packages in R.</p>
<p>My supervisor encouraged me to attend the <a href="https://user2020.r-project.org/">useR! conference</a>. Initially, the conference was scheduled to take place in Zurich in 2020, but it was converted to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, I attended the conference remotely and participated in an R-Ladies meeting for the first time. Although it was an online event, I was impressed by the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the meeting, I recognized one of my acquaintances from Zurich, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seraphina-kissling-625048197/">Seraphina</a>, who had a master’s in biostatistics. We struck up a conversation about how great the meeting was and wondered if there was an R-Ladies chapter in Zurich. To our surprise, we discovered there wasn’t one. There were no active R-Ladies chapters in Switzerland at that time; some had been started but had unfortunately ceased their activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a use for R, although I’m not sure about its prominence in industry. Official statistics at both the canton and federal levels often rely heavily on R. However, the industrial use of R can be a bit more challenging, primarily because many people are now using Python. It depends on what you want to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that with the rise of machine learning and AI, the role of R in industry has shifted. However, it is still included in university curricula. When pursuing a master’s degree in data science, students will encounter R at some point. This means that those entering the industry have at least a little experience working with R, but likely, they don’t use it in their everyday work. The people who do utilize R tend to be in a niche market, often focused on statistics. For instance, in risk analysis or research roles within the industry, R is still used, but it remains a more specialized tool.</p>
<p>In my current role at a consulting firm specializing in data science, we utilize R because we recognize its power and the extent to which it can be leveraged.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-industry-are-you-currently-in-how-do-you-use-r-in-your-work">What industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?</h2>
<p>I work at a data science consultancy where we primarily use R for all our projects. This includes data cleaning, producing graphs, and extracting relevant insights through modelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often work with large datasets and develop reporting tools using Markdown and Quarto to create presentations, even when they don’t involve R. However, when we do want to incorporate R elements, we can do so in a flexible manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have an entire ecosystem of <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a> apps for internal use. For example, we have a system for tracking timesheets, where we collect the hours worked on various projects, along with the corresponding job codes. This data is automatically gathered and helps us produce invoices, as we can easily see how many hours each person has worked on specific tasks.</p>
<p>While we are strong proponents of using R, this approach may be more of an exception than the norm. Nonetheless, R offers numerous capabilities that enable us to accomplish a wide range of tasks. Everything we do typically starts in RStudio, from which we work on various projects.</p>

<p>It’s been a positive journey for me and Seraphina, the co-founder of R-Ladies Zurich. During the early stages, I was deeply immersed in my PhD studies, which connected me with many individuals who used R. Meanwhile, Seraphina was working at a company that also utilized R and maintained ties to academia. This connection proved beneficial, as I was able to book university rooms for free, which helped us secure a venue for our events when we had limited funds.</p>
<p>Initially, we relied on our networks to attract attendees to our events. As we began, people we knew showed interest, and gradually, we opened our events to newcomers. Platforms like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rladies-zurich/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rladieszurich/">Instagram</a> played a significant role in this growth. A friend of Seraphina, Tieu Khe, who specializes in marketing, helped us by creating a beautiful corporate identity for R-Ladies Zurich, which we still use today. This corporate identity has significantly enhanced our online visibility, enabling more people to discover us and participate in our events.</p>
<p>Meetup has been crucial in this process; without it, many people wouldn’t be aware of our events. The platform notifies users via email about our upcoming gatherings, and we’ve seen numerous new attendees as a result. While many regulars continue to participate, we understand that people’s interests can shift, especially when they change fields or jobs, which may lead them to stop using R and consequently not attend our events.</p>
<p>As for our upcoming events, we currently don’t have any specific ones lined up. However, we’re considering a joint event with the Zurich R User Group. Traditionally, we focus on interactive formats rather than frontal presentations, aiming to engage participants directly and encourage them to take an active role and get involved.</p>
<p>Organizing these events requires considerable effort, and we’re currently facing a shortage of presenters. We do have one potential presenter in the pipeline, but the timeline remains uncertain. We have discussed collaborating with the Zurich R User Group to develop a workshop format for a larger audience, likely targeting the fall. Although we haven’t set a specific date yet, we anticipate being able to coordinate something after everyone returns from their summer vacations.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-have-been-the-key-challenges-and-lessons-in-organizing-r-ladies-zurich-over-the-past-four-years">What have been the key challenges and lessons in organizing R-Ladies Zurich over the past four years?</h2>
<p>This is the fourth year we’ve been involved with this project, having started the chapter and managed it. We’re trying to figure out how to maintain some continuity, which has been one of our biggest challenges. People change, and their careers evolve. For instance, I still use R, but Céline, co-organiser of R-Ladies Zurich, is no longer using it.</p>
<p>So, we’re considering how to sustain the community as people shift and change. Currently, we find ourselves in a transitional phase, attempting to define what this space represents. We have a Meetup group, but organizing events requires a lot of work, from finding locations to managing logistics. It’s becoming increasingly complex for me, especially since I’m no longer at the university.</p>
<p>This situation may not be the most exciting news, but it’s an essential reality that every chapter faces: transitions and changes. Currently, we aren’t conducting online events. Otherwise, I would suggest that people follow us online. If you’re visiting Zurich and would like to connect, please don’t hesitate to reach out. It’s very easy to get in touch, and there’s a welcoming community here. Although R remains significant, it’s essential to acknowledge that many other programming languages also play a crucial role in keeping this community alive.</p>

Update (December 10, 2025)
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This post has been updated to more accurately characterize pkglite’s role in regulatory submissions. We regret any impression that pkglite was merely a stopgap solution: it remains a principled, peer-reviewed approach that continues to serve the community well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Over the past several years, the <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">R Consortium Regulatory Submission Working Group</a> has conducted multiple pilots to explore and validate the use of R in regulatory submissions. One recurring challenge surfaced early in our work:</p>
<p><strong>How should sponsors submit non-public R packages—especially those containing proprietary information—to the FDA?</strong></p>
<p>For security reasons, FDA’s eCTD portal historically allowed only a highly restricted set of file formats. As a result, standard R package formats such as compressed files were not accepted. In Pilot 1 and Pilot 2, we used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkglite"><strong>pkglite</strong></a> to convert R packages into a plain text bundle. This approach, documented in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17407745221123244">peer-reviewed paper</a> in <em>Clinical Trials</em>, proved highly effective: the FDA reviewer successfully reproduced our analysis results by following the instructions in the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG). The pkglite workflow offers distinct advantages: human-readable output, full transparency, easy version control, and language-agnostic design, that remain valuable regardless of which file formats the eCTD gateway accepts.</p>

<p>We are pleased to share that the FDA has expanded its list of acceptable file formats to better support R workflows.</p>
<p>This update—found in the August 2025 revision of the <em>FDA eCTD Technical Conformance Guide</em> (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download?attachment">link to guidance</a>)—was directly informed by multi-year collaboration between industry partners and FDA reviewers participating in the R Consortium Regulatory Submission Working Group.</p>
<p>Through joint pilots, repeated feedback, and hands-on testing, FDA colleagues gained deeper visibility into how R packages are used and what formats are needed to preserve functionality and reproducibility.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-2025-08-20-update-includes"><strong>The 2025-08-20 update includes:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Section 9.3 – Updated references</strong><br>
Newly accepted Modeling &amp; Simulation file types:<br>
<code>.rds</code>, <code>.rdb</code>, <code>.rdx</code>, <code>.rdata</code> / <code>.rda</code>, <code>.md</code>, <code>.rd</code> (for delivering R packages)</p>
<p>Expanded permissible use of:<br>
<code>.zip</code> and <code>.html</code> (for delivering full R packages)</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors can now submit non-public R packages directly as a .zip file.</strong></p>
<p>This significantly reduces friction for organizations that rely on internal or proprietary R packages as part of their submission workflows.</p>

<section id="recommendation-open-source-when-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendation-open-source-when-possible"><strong>Recommendation: Open-Source When Possible</strong></h2>
<p>Although submitting proprietary R packages is now easier, the Working Group continues to strongly recommend that organizations <strong>open-source their R packages whenever feasible</strong>.</p>
<p>Reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>Reproducibility</strong><br>
Public repositories (e.g., CRAN, GitHub) allow FDA reviewers and other users to retrieve, install, and verify dependencies reliably.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency in dependency handling</strong><br>
Open-source packages minimize hidden or fragile dependency structures, supporting long-term reproducibility.</p>
<p><strong>Trust and community validation</strong><br>
Open-source tools benefit from broader testing, feedback, and shared maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong><br>
Packages with a public footprint are more likely to be updated and maintained over time, benefiting the entire community.</p>
<p>In summary, while the updated guidance provides much-needed flexibility, open-source remains the most reliable path for transparency, reproducibility, and trust.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/uzairdatascientist/">Muhammad Uzair Aslam</a>, founder of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/karachi-r-user-group/">Karachi R User Group</a>, spoke with the R Consortium about growing an open and volunteer-led R community in Pakistan—one of the first of its kind in the country. Since starting the group in 2023, Uzair has focused on building trust, increasing awareness of R, and creating accessible events for learners across cities. The R Consortium <a href="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-for-public-health-data-analysis-in-karachi-pakistan/index.html">spoke with Uzair about the Karachi R User Group’s work with R for Public Health Data Analysis previously</a>. This time, Uzair is sharing how the group has evolved from informal online meetups to hosting international speakers and publishing sessions on YouTube. He also discussed the community’s rising interest in tools like Quarto and ggplot2, recent consulting work in industrial forecasting using R, and the ongoing challenge of encouraging more local contributions.</p>

<p>Since we last spoke, our user group has made significant strides in growth and community engagement. We started this initiative in 2023 with just 10 to 15 members. During that first year, our focus was on building the foundation—introducing the concept of an open, volunteer-led R community in Pakistan, which was the first of its kind in the country. One of our key challenges early on was gaining trust and clarifying that these events are completely free and community-driven, with no commercial backing.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/a-first-for-pakistan-karachi-r-user-group-builds-r-ecosstem-from-scratch/KarachiRUGlogo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In 2024, we began organising more frequent and structured events, which led to a noticeable increase in interest and participation. Our commitment to consistency and open learning helped establish our reputation, and we gradually grew to a community of over 500 members—a major milestone for us.</p>
<p>In 2025, we started inviting international speakers to bring in global perspectives and inspire our members. In April, we hosted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-horne-datacove/">Jeremy Horne</a>, an experienced R practitioner, whose talk was very well-received and added tremendous value to our growing community.</p>
<p>While attendance started modestly at around 10 to 15 participants per session, we are now seeing numbers reach up to 20 attendees, reflecting a steady and encouraging upward trend. Overall, it’s been a rewarding journey, and we’re excited to continue expanding our reach and impact in the months ahead.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-you-hosting-all-your-events-online">Are you hosting all your events online?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Currently, we are planning to host all our events online. The primary goal is to increase visibility and awareness of our meetup community and make participation more accessible for people across different cities. By focusing on building a consistent online presence, we aim to reach a wider audience and encourage regular engagement. Once we achieve a steady attendance of around 20 participants per session, we plan to transition into in-person meetups as well. Hosting physical events is one of our key objectives for this year, as it will allow us to strengthen community bonds and foster deeper collaboration among members.</p>

Have there been any developments or shifts in how R is being adopted or perceived locally?</h2>
<p>Yes, since we last spoke, I’ve observed a noticeable and encouraging shift in the adoption of R within Pakistan. Through our regular community meetups and workshops, more individuals—especially students and early-career professionals—are beginning to explore and use R. While Python remains popular, our efforts in hosting free workshops and open community sessions have helped introduce R to a broader audience. This has contributed to a positive shift in perception across both industry and academia.</p>
<p>In academic circles, students increasingly find R accessible for statistical computing, data analysis, and academic publishing, thanks to its rich ecosystem of packages and reproducible reporting tools like Quarto. In the industry, there’s a gradual but growing recognition of R’s value, particularly in domains that require strong statistical modelling and data visualisation. Overall, the R community in Pakistan is slowly but steadily expanding, with a growing sense of curiosity, collaboration, and openness to learning.</p>

Are there any tools or techniques that have been particularly helpful to you?</h2>
<p>Building and organising our community has come with its fair share of challenges. One of the most persistent issues has been the lack of speaker availability. It’s often difficult to motivate individuals to present their work or actively participate in discussions. While I’ve delivered several talks myself—both within Pakistan and internationally—encouraging others to step up and share their knowledge remains a tough task. Another major challenge is attracting and retaining attendees. To address this, I created a dedicated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/karachi-r-user-group/">LinkedIn page</a> for the Karachi User Group last year, aimed at raising awareness and promoting our meetups. Despite these efforts, generating consistent interest and boosting attendance continues to be an ongoing effort.</p>
<p>To improve engagement, I’ve been leveraging multiple social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, where I regularly post event updates in relevant groups. The WhatsApp group, in particular, has helped foster better communication and a sense of community among members. More recently, we launched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Karachi_R_User_Group">YouTube</a> channel where we upload recordings of all our meetups. This not only ensures accessibility for those who can’t attend live but also helps us build a wider presence online. These tools and strategies have been instrumental in addressing some of our key challenges and continue to shape the way we grow our community.</p>

<p>We recently hosted an engaging talk on our Meetup group by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zahid-asghar/">Dr.&nbsp;Zahid Asghar</a> from Islamabad University titled “Reporting Champions Trophy Data using Quarto and R.” The session introduced the community to Quarto as a modern tool for creating parameterised, automated, and visually rich reports. Using real-world data from the ESPN Cricinfo API, Dr.&nbsp;Zahid demonstrated how to generate customised player statistics reports—blending R’s data manipulation capabilities with Quarto’s dynamic reporting features. This topic was chosen to help data professionals move beyond static dashboards and adopt reproducible, scalable reporting workflows, and it was well-received by attendees for its practical relevance and clarity.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.statdevs.com/">Stat Devs</a>, one of our recent consulting projects involved developing a long-term demand forecasting model for <a href="https://ffc.com.pk/">Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC)</a>, using the R programming language. The goal was to project Urea sales demand for the next 15 years based on 29 years of historical data. We used multiple time series regression models in R, incorporating economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and external variables such as Cropped Acreage and Water Availability. R proved particularly effective due to its strong statistical modelling capabilities and advanced visualisation tools like <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, which helped us uncover meaningful patterns and clearly communicate insights. The resulting forecasts supported FFC’s capacity planning and strategic decision-making, demonstrating the real-world value of R in industrial analytics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahronak47/?originalSubdomain=in">Ronak Shah</a>, co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pune-r-userr-group/">Pune R User Group</a> in India, is energizing a growing R community that connects students, professionals, and data enthusiasts across the city. Through in-person and online meetups, the group fosters collaboration and learning while supporting R’s expanding role in India’s pharmaceutical industry. Ronak also discussed his side project, Package Reviewer, a Shiny app that enables users to rate and review R packages, helping others discover reliable tools within the R ecosystem.</p>

<p>My name is Ronak, and I’m based in Pune, India. I have been using R for the last 11 years. This year, we launched the Pune R User Group, designed for R enthusiasts and colleagues who utilise R in their daily work or are interested in learning more about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of the co-organizers of the group, I am fortunate to have found other colleagues who share a strong interest in R. We are working to organize events and meet-ups in Pune to foster learning and growth within the R community.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-india">Can you share what the R community is like in India?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The use of R has increased significantly over the past few years, particularly within the pharmaceutical industry. We are witnessing a growth in open-source tools, particularly within the pharma space, tools such as the <a href="https://pharmaverse.org/">Pharmaverse</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/teal/index.html">Teal</a> packages. Many pharmaceutical companies have established Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India, not just in Pune.</p>
<p>Currently, I work with <a href="https://www.rocheindia.com/">Roche</a>, a pharmaceutical company that has its GCC setup in Pune. However, there are numerous other locations, such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Mumbai, where many talented developers contribute to this ecosystem. The growth of these developers working with pharmaceutical companies is happening rapidly.</p>
<p>In Pune specifically, about 50% of our R user group consists of master’s students. They are studying R as part of their coursework and are also conducting projects using R. This has led to a strong interest in the meetups we organize, and I see a lot of traction and growth happening in this area as well.</p>

<p>We initially started with in-person meetups at Pune University, where we reserved some rooms to make it easier for students to join our community. This was one of the reasons why more students began participating. During the summer and monsoon seasons, especially when the rains were heavy, we also decided to incorporate online sessions. This not only allowed local enthusiasts to join but also attracted those situated outside Pune, helping us grow our user base. Going forward, we plan to maintain a mix of both virtual and on-site events, ensuring we cater to everyone’s preferences.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-your-plans-for-the-group-over-the-next-few-months">What are your plans for the group over the next few months?</h2>
<p>When we started this year, the initial plan was to have one meetup every month. However, we have taken a brief break, and we haven’t met in August and September. After six months, we decided to regroup and reorganize to evaluate our approach and determine our satisfaction with it. Currently, we have five co-organizers who are primarily responsible for decision-making regarding the organization of these meetups and the topics we want to cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to analyze what has gone well and identify areas for improvement and change. We are currently working on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we focused on the basics of R, but now we plan to move on to some advanced topics. We have also hosted a couple of sessions on introduction to Shiny, including a hands-on workshop. We would now like to introduce more advanced-level topics in R, which we plan to cover in the coming months.</p>

<section id="what-challenges-have-you-faced-while-organizing-the-group" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-challenges-have-you-faced-while-organizing-the-group">What challenges have you faced while organizing the group?</h2>
<p>We are facing a couple of challenges. First, it remains challenging to find enthusiasts who are interested in R and bring them together on a single online platform. We are exploring various initiatives to address this, including leveraging LinkedIn and utilizing our mutual connections. However, it remains a challenge to attract these individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when we do find people, getting them to attend events can be difficult. We usually schedule these sessions on weekends when they are typically free, but we still encounter obstacles in encouraging their participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage attendance, we are considering relocating our events to a more convenient location. For example, we might arrange to hold them in a café setting and provide coffee and snacks. This external motivation could encourage more participants to join us. We’re hopeful that these changes will be effective, and we look forward to seeing the results in upcoming months.</p>
<p>Please share about a project you are currently working on or have worked on in the past using the R language. Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?</p>
<p>One challenge I noticed is that, while there are many well-known packages, such as dplyr, data.table, and ggplot2, which are thoroughly tested and come with extensive user feedback, a vast array of other packages—over 20,000 on CRAN alone, with numerous more on GitHub—exist. This raises the question: how can users assess the quality of these lesser-known packages? Are they still being actively maintained? Is there someone available to respond to user reports?</p>
<p>To address this issue, I created a simple Shiny app called Package Reviewer. In this app, users can select any package they have tried and rate it on a scale of 0 to 5 stars. Users can give half-star ratings (e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc.) and add a brief comment to describe their experience with the package.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to encourage enough user participation so that when someone is considering trying out a new package, they can visit Package Reviewer to see community reviews. This way, they can summarize feedback and understand how the package has been received, helping them make informed decisions about whether to use that package or seek alternatives. That’s the idea behind Package Reviewer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://shahronak.shinyapps.io/packagerevieweR/">Package Reviewer</a> and share your thoughts on the R packages you use! Your reviews can help fellow R users find dependable tools and provide developers with valuable feedback to further improve their packages. (Note: Registration is not required to use Package Reviewer. On the main page, use the pulldown menu to select an R package review. For example, AATTools.)</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://paolobosetti.quarto.pub/">Dr Paolo Bosetti</a>, Associate Professor at the University of Trento, Italy, recently spoke with the R Consortium about founding the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-trento-users-group/">R-Trento User Group</a> (R-TUG) and fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and the public sector in Italy. He shared how he uses R in teaching industrial engineering students, from integrating RStudio and Quarto into coursework to emphasizing reproducible analysis and reporting. Dr.&nbsp;Paolo also discussed the development of his <code>adas.utils</code> package for experimental design, the importance of documenting community activities through a group blog, and his vision for expanding the R community in Trento.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p>I am an Associate Professor at the University of Trento, working in academia. I have been a long-time user of R, having started around 2004 or 2005, which means I’ve been using R for about 20 years. I utilize R regularly for teaching purposes, particularly in my statistics and data analysis course for undergraduate industrial engineering students.</p>
<p>My focus is on the application of statistical methods in various contexts, including process control, experimental design, and industrial experiments. For teaching, I use R and specifically RStudio, which serves as the primary toolkit for my courses. I prepare all my teaching materials using RStudio and Quarto, including slides and handouts. The course is designed to be highly interactive; we begin with theoretical concepts presented on interactive slides prepared with Quarto, and then transition into RStudio for hands-on analysis, study, and data presentation from experiments.</p>
<p>Within my university, I have several colleagues across different departments—such as economics, industrial engineering, bioengineering, and information technology—who also use R as a tool for data analysis. To foster this community, I initiated a local R user group, known as <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-trento-users-group/">R-TUG</a>. We held our first meeting in late May 2025.</p>
<p>We are using Meetup to gather users, and the group currently has around over 80 members. At our inaugural meeting, approximately 30 users participated, and we conducted a total of four presentations on various topics over the course of three hours in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The first meeting was held in person because we wanted to foster connections. Since it was our initial gathering, it was essential for us to come together and get to know one another. Although we are all part of the same university, many of us only knew each other by name. This meeting provided an opportunity to see each other’s faces and establish those connections.</p>
<p>For future meetings, we plan to implement a hybrid format. We will continue to meet in person while also recording the sessions on Zoom and providing a link for others to participate remotely. This way, we can maintain our in-person interactions while accommodating those who wish to join online.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-italy">Can you share what the R community is like in Italy?</h2>
<p>Our group consists of approximately half academics and half industry members, including some of my former students and representatives from the public sector. We have connections with local government statistical offices in industrial communities. One such community is <a href="https://www.confindustria.it/en/">Confindustria</a>, the association of local industries, which has a statistical study office that contributes to our group.</p>
<p>The strength of our collaboration lies in bridging the gap between academia and the broader world. We facilitate connections between academics and individuals with in-depth knowledge, particularly in the theoretical aspects of statistics and the R programming language. Conversely, we provide academics with access to real-world cases and practical applications, enabling them to gather new ideas and explore innovative applications related to their research.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aside-from-meetup-which-other-platforms-are-you-using-for-your-r-user-group">Aside from Meetup, which other platforms are you using for your R User Group?</h2>
<p>We also have a Quarto-based <a href="https://rtug.unitn.it/">website</a> for our group. It is organized as a blog where we publish small articles contributed by our members, as well as presentations given during meetings. Our goal is to maintain a dynamic online presence by publishing one or two posts per year and documenting our meetings and activities. For each meeting, we will list the topics discussed and make the presentations available. Lastly, we have a list of founding members and regular members, which is also available on Meetup. This captures the life of our group, showcasing our projects and contributions.</p>
<p>We also have a list of <a href="https://rtug.unitn.it/members.html">founding members</a> on our website. Most of the members joined on the first day, and they come from various departments at the same university. However, Maria Michela Dickson, a former member of the University of Trento, is currently a professor at the University of Padua in a different city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also maintain a list of regular members, comprising professionals from various sectors. This group consists of professors, representatives from the public sector, and employees from private companies in the mechanical sector. We are affiliated with the local industry association, which serves as a platform for industrial partners, and we also have members from public foundations.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there are spontaneously joining members on Meetup. I have been automating the process of connecting Meetup subscribers with our local Google email group. My university uses Google Workspace for emails, and we have a shared drive and a Google group for collecting members.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Meetup API was recently changed, which has rendered previous automation packages ineffective. I attempted to write a new solution, but it remains unclear how to do so, and my efforts have not been successful. As a result, Meetup is not providing full access, and I find myself stuck.</p>
<p>This situation is frustrating because it requires considerable time to keep the Meetup user list synchronized with our internal user list. This issue will be resolved sooner or later.</p>

<p>I’ve been using R for more than 20 years now, and I’ve recently completely transitioned to the latest features in R. I’m extensively using the Tidyverse package and have shifted from older methods to Tidyverse approaches. Nowadays, I only teach my students to use Tidyverse and Quarto. Everything we do is presented in a notebook style, utilizing Tidyverse, and I’m particularly focused on how to present analysis effectively. Our current environment is superior to others for this reason.</p>
<p>The quality of the documents we can create using RStudio, R, Tidyverse, and Quarto is significantly better than what can be achieved with other environments commonly used for data analysis, such as MATLAB or Python. Additionally, you can integrate both Python and R within RStudio, but that’s another story.</p>
<p>My primary focus in teaching prospective industrial engineers is to emphasize the quality of both analysis and presentation, as well as the automation of documentation production. This includes automated reports, weekly reports, and similar outputs.</p>

<p>During this course, I also began developing a package called <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adas.utils/index.html"><code>adas.utils</code></a>, which is currently on CRAN. Initially, it started as a collection of utility functions but has evolved into a complete set of objects and methods for applying Design of Experiments (DoE) techniques in a Tidyverse manner.</p>
<p>For example, I use <code>ggplot</code> for graphics, and functions have been designed to be sequentially piped with the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator. While other packages for designing experiments are already available on CRAN, they follow an “old school” approach and do not adhere to a Tidyverse interface. My package stands out because it employs the principles of piping operations and sequencing operations, and utilizes <code>ggplot</code> for visual outputs. The package is now relatively mature.</p>
<p>In our blog, you can find an <a href="https://rtug.unitn.it/posts/004-adas.utils/">introduction to the package</a>, which is designed to facilitate the creation of target plans and fractional factorial plans, as well as to analyze the alias structure in fractional factorial designs. The package also features functionalities not commonly available in R, such as normal probability plots and Pareto charts, both of which are not standard in the Tidyverse.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-cleveland">Can you share what the R community is like in Cleveland?</h2>
<p>There is still interest in the R language, if our meetup attendance is any indicator. We typically see a few new faces each time we host a session, whether in-person or online. There are companies from a variety of industries situated in Cleveland – insurance, medical, financial, consulting, among other services – and you can find practicing data science professionals within all of these.</p>
<p>R is a pleasant and beautiful language to work in, and this is what I hope to share with people regardless of their background. The sessions that we host, and plan to host, are aimed at this objective in mind.</p>

Can you share more about the topic? Why this topic?</h2>
<p>We, as data science professionals, are at a crossroad or inflection point in what it looks like to find a job and build a career right now. It’s been noted that since 2020, in the U.S., recent college graduates are seeing higher unemployment rates now relative to all workers, a departure from 30-year patterns according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Generative AI is developing into an arms race between those hiring and those seeking to be hired – applicants can fabricate resumes and submit more widely than ever before, while companies increase usage of automated screening tools (and occasionally automated interviewing) using AI. And regardless of the current efficacy of AI, there are grumblings of generative agentic AI supplanting entry-level positions. It’s a period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>In a primarily in-person event with a few online participants, we invited a panel of data science professionals who have either successfully navigated the job search environment recently, were in the process of searching for a job, or were making hiring decisions at their place of work. These were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jairaj-ranchod-223b4975/">Jai Ranchod</a>, a business systems analyst working at Availity since 2023, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-montgomery-6b17421b1/">Aaron Montgomery</a>, a data scientist consultant working at Valtech, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-vanderleest-6674a87b/">Josh Vanderleest</a>, a manager of data science working at Progressive Insurance.</p>
<p>We asked the panel a variety of questions related to the hiring process today. Some examples were: How often did you get interviews from applications? How do you perceive the relative marketability of R versus Python today? Does generative technology help or hinder the job search? Emergent topics discussed were the added difficulty of the job search for international students and imposter syndrome among those seeking to break into the field.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The consensus was that “hit rates” for interviews were fair – perhaps one in twenty – but not as egregious as some internet stories (one in hundreds).</p></li>
<li><p>Tooling (R vs.&nbsp;Python) was not at the forefront of managers’ minds; rather, it was the capability to reason well about data analytical problems that was more important.</p></li>
<li><p>Generative AI is a facet of modern job application – one audience member explained how it was used in a technical interview – but integrity and honesty nevertheless continue to be vital.</p></li>
<li><p>Resumes exist to get you in front of the hiring manager – and should be formatted explicitly demonstrating how you satisfy minimum qualifications.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Practicing interview questions using established methods like STAR can be very useful – check to see if answering questions in this format is a requirement of the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the session, we offered resume review comments for all participants. We may not have solved the hiring process with this panel discussion, but it was an enlightening and engaging discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://greatercle.com/events/2025/09/09/signature-event/best-of-tech-day-2025/">Cleveland’s Best of Tech</a> is an annual event hosting tech companies, organizations, and educators. The Greater Cleveland Partnership organizes it, and this year it was held at the Great Lakes Science Center. Our group was offered a booth spot to share our program with participants.</p>
<p>I was extremely pleased to meet the organizers of other tech groups in Cleveland. I met the organizers of the <a href="https://www.datadayscle.org/">Data Days Cleveland group</a> (April Urban, Will Skora), and I also met the organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cleveland-area-python-interest-group/">Cleveland Python meetup</a> (CLEpy) for the first time – Anurag Saxena, who works at the Cleveland Clinic. I am inspired to interface more with these groups, and we discussed the possibility of hosting a joint R+Python meetup sometime next year, which I am excited to plan!</p>
<p>We had many other participants visit the booth, and a key takeaway for me was interest in beginner-level training in R. I have thought of this as something that the Cleveland R User group could offer in the future, possibly another activity that could be co-facilitated by the R and Python meetups.</p>
<p>Overall, I am happy to see the good health of the data profession scene in Cleveland. Meeting other group organizers has already expanded my network; I attended a Data Days workshop event soon thereafter and had the pleasure of meeting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drosohrabian/">Dro Sohrabian</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-martinez-975b37191/">Samuel Martinez</a> with the City of Cleveland, demonstrating their <a href="https://data.clevelandohio.gov/">Open Data Portal</a>. Further meshing with technical meetup leaders will open a lot more doors for connectivity and inspire interesting sessions in the future; I plan to introduce our members to the City’s data portal in our next guided walkthrough session.</p>

  <title>Jarl: just another R linter</title>
  <dc:creator>Etienne Bacher</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/jarl-just-another-r-linter/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Original post here: <a href="https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2025-11-20-introducing-jarl/">Jarl: just another R linter</a></em></p>
<!-- DON'T FORGET ALT TEXT FOR GIFS -->
<p>I’m very excited to introduce Jarl<sup>1</sup>, a new R linter. A linter is a tool that statically parses code (meaning that it doesn’t run the code in question) and searches for patterns that are inefficient, hard to read, or likely bugs. Jarl can parse dozens of files and thousands of lines of code in milliseconds. Here is an example of Jarl running on <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/">r-source</a> (approximately 1000 files and 200k lines of R code) in about 700 milliseconds:</p>
<video width="100%" alt="Running `jarl check . --with-timing` on the 'r-source' repository. This runs in about 700ms and returns hundreds of rule violations detailing the diagnostic and how to fix it." controls="">
<source src="lint-r-source.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>On top of that, Jarl can apply automatic fixes<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<p>Suppose that we have the following file <code>foo.R</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1">x <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">any</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">is.na</span>(mtcars))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3">f <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb1-4">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">apply</span>(x, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">1</span>, mean)</span>
<span id="cb1-5">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are two rule violations in this file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>any(is.na(mtcars))</code> should be replaced by <code>anyNA(mtcars)</code><sup>3</sup></li>
<li><code>apply(x, 1, mean)</code> should be replaced by <code>rowMeans(x)</code><sup>4</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of fixing those cases by hand, we can run the following command in the terminal (not in the R console):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">jarl</span> check foo.R <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--fix</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>After running this, <code>foo.R</code> now contains the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">x <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">anyNA</span>(mtcars)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">f <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rowMeans</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb3-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that <code>f</code> is now useless since it is equivalent to <code>rowMeans()</code>.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jarl stands on the shoulders of giants, in particular:</p>

<li><code>lintr</code>: this R package provides dozens of rules for linting R code, and Jarl wouldn’t exist without this package. Jarl currently supports 25 <code>lintr</code> rules.</li>
<li>Air: this is a fast R formatter written in Rust, developed by Lionel Henry and Davis Vaughan, and released earlier this year. It is also a command-line tool that runs in the terminal. It is the technical foundation on which Jarl is built since Air provides the infrastructure to parse and manipulate R code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jarl is a single binary, meaning that it doesn’t need an R installation to work. This makes it a very attractive option for continuous integration for instance, since it takes less than 10 seconds to download the binary and run it on the repository.</p>
<section id="using-jarl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-jarl">Using Jarl</h2>
<p>There are two ways to use Jarl:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>via the terminal, using <code>jarl check [OPTIONS]</code>;</li>
<li>using the integration in your coding editor (at the time of writing, a Jarl extension is available in VS Code, Positron, and Zed).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jarl extension enables code highlighting and quick fixes. The former means that code that violates any of the rules in your setup (more on this below) will be underlined and will show the exact violation when hovered.</p>
<video width="100%" alt="This shows the same file 'foo.R', but this time the two pieces of code that violate the rules are underlined in yellow. Hovering these two pieces of code show a popup detailing the diagnostic." controls="">
<source src="hover.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>The latter adds a lightbulb button next to rule violations, allowing you to selectively apply fixes.</p>
<video width="100%" height="100%" alt="This shows the same file 'foo.R'. This time, clicking on the code that violate the rules displays a small lightbulb icon that applies the automatic fix when clicked." controls="">
<source src="automatic-fixes.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p>In the future, those extensions could have a “Fix on save” feature similar to the “Format on save” functionality provided by Air.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-jarl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configuring-jarl">Configuring Jarl</h2>
<p>By default, Jarl will report violations for almost of its rules. It is possible to configure its behavior using a configuration file named <code>jarl.toml</code>. In particular, in this file, you can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rules you want to apply,</li>
<li>the files to include or exclude,</li>
<li>the rules for which you want to apply automatic fixes,</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Jarl is in its early days, there are more rules and options to add. Still, it can already be used in interactive use or in continuous integration (check out the <a href="https://github.com/etiennebacher/setup-jarl"><code>setup-jarl</code> workflow</a>!). Eventually, many <code>lintr</code> rules should be supported in Jarl, but the end goal is not to have perfect compatibility. <code>lintr</code> provides many rules related to code formatting (e.g.&nbsp;spaces_inside_linter). Those will not be integrated in Jarl since they are already covered by Air. Additionally (for now), Jarl cannot perform semantic analysis<sup>5</sup>, meaning that some <code>lintr</code> rules are out of scope (e.g.&nbsp;unreachable_code_linter).</p>
<p>This was a very light introduction, go to the <a href="https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/">Jarl website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If you want to help developing Jarl, check out the <a href="https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/contributing">“Contributing” page</a>. Jarl is written in Rust, which may be a barrier to contributing but is also a very powerful language which is a real pleasure to use. I will add a more detailed tutorial soon so that this can also be a nice introduction to this language. You can also contribute to the documentation!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenges-of-llms-correctness-transparency-and-reproducibility">The Challenges of LLMs: Correctness, Transparency, and Reproducibility</h2>
<p>LLMs present inherent challenges when evaluated against the principles of correctness, transparency, and reproducibility. They are notorious for generating convincing but incorrect answers, operate as black boxes with limited transparency, and inherently lack reproducibility due to their non-deterministic nature. Despite these challenges, Cheng argued that LLMs can still be used responsibly with the right approaches.</p>

<section id="approaches-to-responsible-use-of-llms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approaches-to-responsible-use-of-llms">Approaches to Responsible Use of LLMs</h2>
<p>Chenged presents three approaches to responsibly leveraging LLMs in data science:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Constrained Use of LLMs</strong>: By identifying specific tasks that LLMs excel at, such as generating SQL queries, and constraining them to these tasks, users can mitigate the risk of errors. The use of deterministic software to augment LLM capabilities ensures that the results are trustworthy. This approach is exemplified by the use of SQL chatbots to drive Shiny dashboards, where the focus is on the correctness of SQL rather than the LLM’s broader capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micromanaging the Model</strong>: This involves maintaining a tight feedback loop between the user and the LLM, allowing for immediate correction of errors. By taking small, manageable steps and closely overseeing the model’s outputs, users can ensure that mistakes are caught promptly. This approach is particularly useful in data visualization, where subjectivity allows for easy judgment of outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deferred Review</strong>: In this approach, users allow the LLM to take larger steps, accumulating a “review debt” that is addressed before the final output is shared. This method offers rapid progress but requires a thorough review to ensure accuracy and reliability. Databot, Posit’s exploratory data analysis agent, exemplifies this approach by generating reproducible reports that users can review and refine.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="balancing-use-and-responsibility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balancing-use-and-responsibility">Balancing Use and Responsibility</h2>
<p>The decision on how to responsibly use LLMs depends on the specific context and the risk tolerance of the user. For instance, those working in marketing may have a higher tolerance for risk compared to individuals in fields where lives are at stake. Cheng emphasized the importance of understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and advises users to find a balance that aligns with their needs and ethical considerations.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Joe Cheng’s keynote at R+AI 2025 provided valuable insights into the responsible use of LLMs in data science and research. By focusing on principles of correctness, transparency, and reproducibility, and adopting approaches that mitigate risks, users can harness the power of LLMs to enhance their workflows while maintaining trust and reliability. Posit’s commitment to open-source software and ethical considerations serves as a strong example for the R community in navigating the evolving landscape of AI.</p>

<p>Large language models entered many data scientists’ lives through small conveniences: better email replies, smoother vacation planning, quick summaries of documentation. For Jasmine Daly, Principal Consultant and Founder of Daly Analytics, the next step was less comfortable: AI could write decent R code and Shiny apps. Did that make years of R experience obsolete? Was this a shortcut that would quietly erode hard-won expertise?</p>
<p>In the R+AI talk “Me, Myself, and Claude: How I Leverage AI-Assisted Development to Scale My R-Based Data Science Consultancy,” Jasmine reframes those fears into a much more productive question: how can AI become a force multiplier for R developers, not a crutch?</p>
</section>
<section id="from-vibe-coding-to-accountable-ai-assisted-development" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-vibe-coding-to-accountable-ai-assisted-development">From “vibe coding” to accountable AI-assisted development</h2>
<p>Jasmine starts with a term many R users have seen online: “vibe coding.” It captures that slightly chaotic feeling of pasting prompts into an AI, grabbing whatever comes out, and hoping it runs. It is funny—but also dangerous. The mindset behind it is essentially:</p>
<ul>
<li>try something</li>
<li>hope it works</li>
<li>do not look too closely at why</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of “vibe coding,” Jasmine prefers “intentional, accountable AI-assisted development.” The shift is not about policing language; it is about accurately describing the work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a real system being built for real organizations<br>
</li>
<li>there are real risks around correctness, maintainability, and security<br>
</li>
<li>a human developer remains responsible for design decisions and outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>For Jasmine, AI is “a new agentic tool in the toolbox,” not a replacement for R expertise. That language matters, especially inside a consultancy where clients rely on clear judgment, not just clever code.</p>
</section>
<section id="mental-bandwidth-as-the-real-bottleneck" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mental-bandwidth-as-the-real-bottleneck">Mental bandwidth as the real bottleneck</h2>
<p>As a solo consultant serving nonprofits and other mission-driven organizations, Jasmine used to spend most working hours writing code: Shiny apps, dashboards, R packages, data pipelines. The result: less time for the work that grows a sustainable practice and strengthens the R community.</p>
<p>AI-assisted development changed that balance. Instead of treating AI as “time savings on tasks already being done,” Jasmine treats it as a <strong>mental bandwidth reallocator</strong>. Offloading boilerplate and repetitive scaffolding frees attention for:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving business operations and systems<br>
</li>
<li>thinking clearly about pricing, profitability, and packaging of services<br>
</li>
<li>building relationships through networking, speaking, and community work</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, this is not about doing less technical work. Jasmine still writes R code nearly every day. The difference is that cognitive load is no longer consumed entirely by syntax and glue code; there is space for bigger-picture thinking and community contribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="turning-personal-tools-into-r-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turning-personal-tools-into-r-packages">Turning personal tools into R packages</h2>
<p>A good example of that shift is the evolution from one-off scripts to reusable packages.</p>
<section id="shinyfa-understanding-large-shiny-codebases" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shinyfa-understanding-large-shiny-codebases"><code>{shinyfa}</code>: understanding large Shiny codebases</h3>
<p>A client Shiny app with a large, unfamiliar codebase was consuming huge onboarding time. To cope, Jasmine wrote ad hoc scripts—supported by Claude Code—to analyze file structure, track <code>render*()</code> and reactive functions, and surface where important logic lived.</p>
<p>Previously, those scripts would have stayed on a local machine. With more bandwidth and AI-assisted help, Jasmine turned that exploratory tooling into a reusable R package: <strong>{shinyfa}</strong>, now on CRAN, which analyzes large Shiny directories and extracts structured information about reactivity patterns and outputs for easier onboarding and refactoring.</p>
</section>
<section id="avilistr-a-weekend-package-powered-by-curiosity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avilistr-a-weekend-package-powered-by-curiosity"><code>{avilistr}</code>: a weekend package powered by curiosity</h3>
<p>Another example came from a personal interest: bird taxonomy. Starting from an Excel file and the newly released AviList global bird checklist, Jasmine used Claude Code to help wrap the data, write documentation, and publish <strong>{avilistr}</strong>, an R package exposing the AviList global avian checklist to R users in a research-ready form.</p>
<p>The technical lift was not extreme. The point is what changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>before AI, that project would likely have stayed a “someday” idea<br>
</li>
<li>with AI-assisted development, it became a polished, documented R package released in a weekend</li>
</ul>
<p>For the R community, this is the upside: more of those “nice-to-have” tools actually get shipped.</p>
</section>

<section id="saying-yes-to-bigger-more-interesting-r-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saying-yes-to-bigger-more-interesting-r-projects">Saying yes to bigger, more interesting R projects</h2>
<p>Jasmine also shows how AI changes the filter for accepting new work.</p>
<p>The old filter was purely capacity-driven:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can this be built in a reasonable timeframe?</li>
<li>With current skills?</li>
<li>Alongside existing client workload?</li>
</ul>
<p>With AI-assisted development, the filter becomes more strategic:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical build is possible.<br>
</li>
<li>The key question is: can there be deep understanding of the client’s desired outcomes, their team’s strengths, and the right “size” of solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>That change leads to more ambitious, higher-impact problems—without requiring 80-hour weeks.</p>
</section>
<section id="claude-code-as-a-senior-and-sometimes-junior-developer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="claude-code-as-a-senior-and-sometimes-junior-developer">Claude Code as a senior (and sometimes junior) developer</h2>
<p>A recurring theme in the talk is Jasmine’s mental model for working with Claude Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jasmine is the <strong>manager and technical lead</strong><br>
</li>
<li>Claude is a <strong>senior, sometimes junior, developer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That means Jasmine:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets direction and architecture<br>
</li>
<li>defines requirements in detail<br>
</li>
<li>reviews every pull request–equivalent output<br>
</li>
<li>remains in and on the loop at all times</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>being specific in prompts and requirements<br>
</li>
<li>always reviewing generated code and context files<br>
</li>
<li>using small, incremental commits to make AI changes auditable<br>
</li>
<li>feeding documentation links and relevant repos so the model has grounded context<br>
</li>
<li>sometimes asking for multiple options, then blending or choosing the simplest approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The R community takeaway: treat AI tools as part of a team that needs leadership, not as an infallible code generator.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-real-world-architecture-50-dashboards-github-actions-and-quarto" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-real-world-architecture-50-dashboards-github-actions-and-quarto">A real-world architecture: 50+ dashboards, GitHub Actions, and Quarto</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling case studies in the talk centers on a client with more than 50 dashboards that needed to scale. Jasmine describes using Claude Code to help assemble a sustainable architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions and YAML workflows to orchestrate builds<br>
</li>
<li>Railway as a virtual machine environment<br>
</li>
<li>Supabase with row-level security for multi-tenant isolation<br>
</li>
<li>Quarto dashboards, each pulling only its own data<br>
</li>
<li>A shared component library and template so features could be toggled on or off</li>
</ul>
<p>The result: “right-sized, enterprise-grade infrastructure” delivered in weeks instead of months, with Jasmine still firmly in technical control. Without AI assistance, that project might have been impractical or too risky for a solo consultant to accept.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-r-intuition-through-volume-not-shortcuts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-r-intuition-through-volume-not-shortcuts">Building R intuition through volume, not shortcuts</h2>
<p>A common fear in the R community is that relying on AI will erode skills. Jasmine’s experience is the opposite: <strong>AI increases the volume and variety of patterns seen</strong>, which, when handled deliberately, strengthens intuition.</p>
<p>She highlights three recurring categories of AI mistakes and what they teach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package confusion</strong> – e.g., misinterpreting <code>{shinyfa}</code> as related to Font Awesome. The fix is to feed documentation URLs and be explicit about which package is in use. This forces better documentation habits.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Data structure assumptions</strong> – incorrect column names or types, or confusing similar datasets. This encourages consistent use of <code>str()</code>, <code>glimpse()</code>, and other inspection tools, and can be mitigated by exposing the real R session via MCP tools so the model sees actual objects.</li>
<li><strong>Over-engineering</strong> – proposing complex graph-based or multi-package solutions where a simple <code>dplyr</code> pipeline would work. Asking for multiple options and explicitly requesting the simplest approach helps counter this tendency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each mistake becomes a prompt-engineering lesson and a design pattern lesson at the same time. Instead of avoiding errors, Jasmine leans into high-volume iteration, using failures to refine both prompts and architectural judgment.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-simple-reflection-framework-for-rai-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-reflection-framework-for-rai-projects">A simple reflection framework for R+AI projects</h2>
<p>In closing, Jasmine offers a practical reflection exercise for anyone starting an AI-assisted R project:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will always be done personally?<br>
</li>
<li>What can AI help with?<br>
</li>
<li>What needs to be understood deeply?<br>
</li>
<li>What is comfortable to delegate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing down the answers before starting a project makes the human/AI division of labor explicit. It also reinforces that responsibility for correctness, ethics, and impact stays with the human developer.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-this-means-for-the-r-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-means-for-the-r-community">What this means for the R community</h2>
<p>The core message to the R community is direct: AI does not automatically make developers lazy or dependent. Used with intention, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>unlock time for community talks, open source work, and mentoring<br>
</li>
<li>turn private scripts into packages that benefit thousands of R users<br>
</li>
<li>enable R consultants to take on more ambitious, higher-impact projects<br>
</li>
<li>accelerate learning by exposing more patterns—while still demanding human judgment</li>
</ul>
<p>Jasmine’s journey from existential dread to strategic partnership with Claude is a blueprint many R users can follow. The tools may be new, but the craft is familiar: thoughtful design, careful review, and a commitment to building software that genuinely helps people.</p>
<p>The invitation is clear: stay human-in-the-loop, build with intention, keep learning—and bring that energy back into the R community.</p>

<section id="building-genai-applications-lessons-from-r-and-python-tooling" class="level1">
<h1>Building GenAI Applications: Lessons from R and Python Tooling</h1>
<p>Generative AI (GenAI) has become an exciting frontier for developers and data scientists eager to infuse applications with intelligent features. The journey at A2-Ai, a team of scientists and developers skilled in languages like R, Python, JavaScript, and more, provides valuable insights into the interplay of R and Python in GenAI tooling. This post delves into key learnings and experiences from building GenAI applications, focusing on tools that enhance communication between elements and back-end systems.</p>
<section id="a-journey-into-genai-from-challenges-to-solutions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-journey-into-genai-from-challenges-to-solutions">A Journey into GenAI: From Challenges to Solutions</h2>
<p>A2-Ai’s exploration into GenAI began with a simple question: “How do I install the <code>dplyr</code> package?” While large language models like ChatGPT offered correct answers, they weren’t always applicable to internal processes. A2-Ai uses an internal tool written in Rust, called RB, for managing installations and environments for R packages. The need to incorporate such internal knowledge into a chatbot led to the development of a unique system built with Shiny for Python. The result was a chatbot capable of fetching precise information from the internal R repository, Prism, and making appropriate API calls.</p>
<p>For example, one colleague developed a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in R, enabling natural language queries for exploratory data analysis within pharmacometrics workflows. This allowed scientists to interact with data by posing questions in English, prompting updates in plots and legends.</p>
<p>While applications are diverse, three core building blocks are essential for building GenAI applications: model interface, context handling, and result validation.</p>
</section>
<section id="core-building-blocks-of-genai-applications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-building-blocks-of-genai-applications">Core Building Blocks of GenAI Applications</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Model Interface</strong>: This manages Language Model (LM) API calls. Despite the dearth of R SDKs for providers like OpenAI, the package <code>{ellmer}</code> has emerged as the go-to tool for R developers. <code>{ellmer}</code> abstracts overhead from HTTP calls, allowing developers to focus on building rather than communication intricacies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Context Handling</strong>: This involves determining the necessary context for LLMs to provide accurate responses. In enterprise environments, internal documentation, codebases, and workflows form part of this context. The robustness of the Python ecosystem, rich with tools for document processing, offers an advantage, but recent R developments are bridging some gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Result Validation</strong>: Ensuring systematic output of desired results is crucial, given the non-deterministic behavior of LM applications. Tools like <code>vital</code> in R and <code>inspect</code> in Python offer mechanisms to evaluate GenAI applications systematically, ensuring improvements are tracked and validated.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="evolution-of-tooling-in-r-and-python" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-of-tooling-in-r-and-python">Evolution of Tooling in R and Python</h2>
<p>R and Python ecosystems have evolved with various packages dealing with model interfaces. The chronological development of these packages reveals a convergence towards <code>{ellmer}</code> for R, while Python’s ecosystem remains diverse due to original SDKs from model providers and other unifying libraries.</p>
<p>The Python ecosystem boasts high-level orchestration frameworks for different use cases, a result of foundational SDKs enabling diverse and rich use-case development. While R’s ecosystem is in a growth phase, new tools are helping it catch up.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategies-for-leveraging-r-and-python-together">Strategies for Leveraging R and Python Together</h2>
<p>Developers need not choose between R and Python. Several strategies exist to leverage both:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R-Only Teams</strong>: Start with <code>{ellmer}</code> and explore packages like <code>{btw}</code> (from Posit), which allow interaction with LLMs within R environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Python-Only Tools</strong>: Use the <code>reticulate</code> package to call Python libraries and functions from R without switching languages entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multilingual Teams</strong>: Use REST APIs to expose tools to other teams, enabling interaction across different languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>: With MCP servers, developers can expose functions in any language as natural language queries, enhancing cross-language interactions.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-and-final-takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-and-final-takeaways">Conclusion and Final Takeaways</h2>
<p>Building GenAI applications with R and Python is an exciting venture, enriched by rapidly evolving ecosystems. While Python offers maturity, R is catching up with robust tools like <code>{ellmer}</code>. The key is to start building and refine applications based on user interactions. Bridging gaps strategically through REST APIs and MCP servers ensures developers leverage the best of both worlds while being mindful of potential risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Engage with the GenAI community, share experiences, and continue learning for a rewarding journey in building innovative applications.</p>
