  <title>Jarl: just another R linter</title>
  <dc:creator>Etienne Bacher</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/jarl-just-another-r-linter/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Original post here: <a href="https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2025-11-20-introducing-jarl/">Jarl: just another R linter</a></em></p>
<!-- DON'T FORGET ALT TEXT FOR GIFS -->
<p>I’m very excited to introduce Jarl<sup>1</sup>, a new R linter. A linter is a tool that statically parses code (meaning that it doesn’t run the code in question) and searches for patterns that are inefficient, hard to read, or likely bugs. Jarl can parse dozens of files and thousands of lines of code in milliseconds. Here is an example of Jarl running on <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/">r-source</a> (approximately 1000 files and 200k lines of R code) in about 700 milliseconds:</p>
<video width="100%" alt="Running `jarl check . --with-timing` on the 'r-source' repository. This runs in about 700ms and returns hundreds of rule violations detailing the diagnostic and how to fix it." controls="">
<source src="lint-r-source.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>On top of that, Jarl can apply automatic fixes<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<p>Suppose that we have the following file <code>foo.R</code>:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1">x <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">any</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">is.na</span>(mtcars))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3">f <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb1-4">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">apply</span>(x, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">1</span>, mean)</span>
<span id="cb1-5">}</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>There are two rule violations in this file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>any(is.na(mtcars))</code> should be replaced by <code>anyNA(mtcars)</code><sup>3</sup></li>
<li><code>apply(x, 1, mean)</code> should be replaced by <code>rowMeans(x)</code><sup>4</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of fixing those cases by hand, we can run the following command in the terminal (not in the R console):</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">jarl</span> check foo.R <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--fix</span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>After running this, <code>foo.R</code> now contains the following code:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">x <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">anyNA</span>(mtcars)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">f <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">rowMeans</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb3-4">}</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>(Note that <code>f</code> is now useless since it is equivalent to <code>rowMeans()</code>.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Jarl stands on the shoulders of giants, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lintr</code>: this R package provides dozens of rules for linting R code, and Jarl wouldn’t exist without this package. Jarl currently supports 25 <code>lintr</code> rules.</li>
<li>Air: this is a fast R formatter written in Rust, developed by Lionel Henry and Davis Vaughan, and released earlier this year. It is also a command-line tool that runs in the terminal. It is the technical foundation on which Jarl is built since Air provides the infrastructure to parse and manipulate R code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jarl is a single binary, meaning that it doesn’t need an R installation to work. This makes it a very attractive option for continuous integration for instance, since it takes less than 10 seconds to download the binary and run it on the repository.</p>
<section id="using-jarl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-jarl">Using Jarl</h2>
<p>There are two ways to use Jarl:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>via the terminal, using <code>jarl check [OPTIONS]</code>;</li>
<li>using the integration in your coding editor (at the time of writing, a Jarl extension is available in VS Code, Positron, and Zed).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jarl extension enables code highlighting and quick fixes. The former means that code that violates any of the rules in your setup (more on this below) will be underlined and will show the exact violation when hovered.</p>
<video width="100%" alt="This shows the same file 'foo.R', but this time the two pieces of code that violate the rules are underlined in yellow. Hovering these two pieces of code show a popup detailing the diagnostic." controls="">
<source src="hover.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p><br></p>
<p>The latter adds a lightbulb button next to rule violations, allowing you to selectively apply fixes.</p>
<video width="100%" height="100%" alt="This shows the same file 'foo.R'. This time, clicking on the code that violate the rules displays a small lightbulb icon that applies the automatic fix when clicked." controls="">
<source src="automatic-fixes.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
<p>In the future, those extensions could have a “Fix on save” feature similar to the “Format on save” functionality provided by Air.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-jarl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configuring-jarl">Configuring Jarl</h2>
<p>By default, Jarl will report violations for almost of its rules. It is possible to configure its behavior using a configuration file named <code>jarl.toml</code>. In particular, in this file, you can specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rules you want to apply,</li>
<li>the files to include or exclude,</li>
<li>the rules for which you want to apply automatic fixes,</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Jarl is in its early days, there are more rules and options to add. Still, it can already be used in interactive use or in continuous integration (check out the <a href="https://github.com/etiennebacher/setup-jarl"><code>setup-jarl</code> workflow</a>!). Eventually, many <code>lintr</code> rules should be supported in Jarl, but the end goal is not to have perfect compatibility. <code>lintr</code> provides many rules related to code formatting (e.g.&nbsp;spaces_inside_linter). Those will not be integrated in Jarl since they are already covered by Air. Additionally (for now), Jarl cannot perform semantic analysis<sup>5</sup>, meaning that some <code>lintr</code> rules are out of scope (e.g.&nbsp;unreachable_code_linter).</p>
<p>This was a very light introduction, go to the <a href="https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/">Jarl website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If you want to help developing Jarl, check out the <a href="https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/contributing">“Contributing” page</a>. Jarl is written in Rust, which may be a barrier to contributing but is also a very powerful language which is a real pleasure to use. I will add a more detailed tutorial soon so that this can also be a nice introduction to this language. You can also contribute to the documentation!</p>

<h1>Gradient Boosting Machines: Are They Still Relevant in the Era of AI and LLMs?</h1>
<p>Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) have long been hailed as the leading machine learning algorithm for structured and tabular data. This reputation has been firmly established over the past decade, particularly in business applications where accuracy and predictive analytics are paramount. However, as Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT rise to prominence, questions about the relevance and potential obsolescence of GBMs are becoming more frequent. <a href="https://szilard.github.io/aboutme/">Szilard Pafka, PhD, Chief Scientist at Epoch</a>, addressed this topic in a compelling talk at the R+AI 2025 event hosted by the R Consortium.</p>
<section id="the-proven-track-record-of-gbms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-proven-track-record-of-gbms">The Proven Track Record of GBMs</h2>
<p>GBMs have been a cornerstone of machine learning since the 2000s, especially in business-related domains where tabular data is prevalent. This data type, organized in rows and columns, is typically stored in relational databases and is the backbone of many practical applications like fraud detection, credit scoring, and marketing analytics. GBMs’ superiority in handling such data is well-documented, with popular implementations like XGBoost, LightGBM, and h2o available as R packages.</p>
<section id="historical-context" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="historical-context">Historical Context</h3>
<p>The efficacy of GBMs in tabular data contexts is supported by numerous studies and benchmarks. A notable 2006 study compared several machine learning algorithms and found that random forests, neural networks, and GBMs consistently delivered the best performance across various datasets. Over the years, GBMs have maintained their status as the go-to solution for structured data, with prominent figures like Tianqi Chen, the creator of XGBoost, highlighting their dominance in competitive environments like Kaggle.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-deep-learning-challenge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deep-learning-challenge">The Deep Learning Challenge</h3>
<p>Despite the success of GBMs, the advent of deep learning over a decade ago promised to revolutionize machine learning. While deep learning conquered domains like computer vision and speech recognition, its application to structured data lagged behind. Szilard Pafka expressed skepticism about deep learning’s ability to outperform GBMs in tabular data contexts, a sentiment supported by empirical evidence and expert consensus.</p>

<section id="the-rise-of-large-language-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rise-of-large-language-models">The Rise of Large Language Models</h2>
<p>The landscape began to shift with the emergence of LLMs such as ChatGPT, which showcased unprecedented capabilities in text understanding and generation. These models have transformed information retrieval and synthesis, often replacing traditional search engines and providing sophisticated code generation and data analysis assistance. However, their application to tabular data remains limited.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-llms-in-machine-learning">The Role of LLMs in Machine Learning</h3>
<p>While LLMs excel in text-based domains, their utility in tabular data tasks is still being explored. Pafka notes that LLMs can aid in idea generation, advice, and code generation, but they have yet to replace the specialized efficiency of GBMs in structured data scenarios. This is due to the inherent differences in data structure and the challenges LLMs face when handling large, complex datasets.</p>

</section>
<section id="benchmarking-gbms-and-llms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benchmarking-gbms-and-llms">Benchmarking GBMs and LLMs</h2>
<p>Pafka’s <a href="https://github.com/szilard/GBM-perf">GBM-perf benchmark</a>, maintained on GitHub, continues to demonstrate the strength of GBMs against newer algorithms, including those involving deep learning and LLMs. The findings consistently place GBMs like XGBoost and CatBoost at the top in terms of performance, especially in classification tasks with tabular data.</p>
<section id="practical-applications-and-deployment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-applications-and-deployment">Practical Applications and Deployment</h3>
<p>The practical deployment of machine learning models is as crucial as their training. H2o.ai, for example, offers seamless integration and deployment capabilities, making it a preferred choice for real-time applications. The ease of deployment and efficient scoring are significant advantages of GBMs, which are often not matched by LLMs in structured data tasks.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="future-prospects-and-conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-prospects-and-conclusion">Future Prospects and Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the AI landscape rapidly evolves, the question remains: can LLMs and other AI advancements supplant GBMs in the domain of tabular data? The current consensus, both among human experts and AI systems like ChatGPT, is that GBMs are still the optimal choice for these tasks. While LLMs hold potential for assisting in various stages of data analysis and machine learning, GBMs continue to be the workhorse for structured data.</p>
<p>The future is uncertain, and as AI technologies advance, new paradigms may emerge. However, for now, GBMs remain an indispensable tool in the data scientist’s arsenal, particularly for business applications involving structured data. Szilard Pafka’s insights reaffirm the enduring relevance of GBMs and highlight the need for continuous adaptation and learning in the face of technological progress.</p>

<section id="harnessing-the-power-of-llms-for-responsible-data-science-and-research" class="level1">
<h1>Harnessing the Power of LLMs for Responsible Data Science and Research</h1>
<p>Joe Cheng, CTO of Posit, delivered a fanstastic keynote to kick off R+AI 2025, focusing on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effectively harnessed for data science and research. As the landscape of AI continues to evolve, Cheng emphasized the importance of utilizing LLMs in a responsible manner, adhering to principles such as correctness, transparency, and reproducibility.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-llms-beyond-conventional-tools" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-llms-beyond-conventional-tools">The Role of LLMs Beyond Conventional Tools</h2>
<p>Cheng set the stage by clarifying that while tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are well-known for their coding assistance, the potential of LLMs extends far beyond these applications. He introduced the concept of utilizing LLMs as custom agents, allowing users to integrate them into their workflows for more tailored and sophisticated tasks. This approach is facilitated by the R package <strong>Elmer</strong>, which allows users with a background in R to easily tap into the capabilities of LLMs.</p>
</section>
<section id="posits-mission-and-ethical-considerations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posits-mission-and-ethical-considerations">Posit’s Mission and Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), Posit is committed to creating open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. The company is driven by a mission that emphasizes the importance of producing trustworthy results, especially in high-stakes scenarios such as healthcare data analysis, drug development, public policy, and environmental studies. Cheng underscores the ethical obligation to ensure that the software and analyses produced are reliable, as users often have no choice but to trust the results.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-challenges-of-llms-correctness-transparency-and-reproducibility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenges-of-llms-correctness-transparency-and-reproducibility">The Challenges of LLMs: Correctness, Transparency, and Reproducibility</h2>
<p>LLMs present inherent challenges when evaluated against the principles of correctness, transparency, and reproducibility. They are notorious for generating convincing but incorrect answers, operate as black boxes with limited transparency, and inherently lack reproducibility due to their non-deterministic nature. Despite these challenges, Cheng argued that LLMs can still be used responsibly with the right approaches.</p>
</section>
<section id="approaches-to-responsible-use-of-llms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approaches-to-responsible-use-of-llms">Approaches to Responsible Use of LLMs</h2>
<p>Chenged presents three approaches to responsibly leveraging LLMs in data science:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Constrained Use of LLMs</strong>: By identifying specific tasks that LLMs excel at, such as generating SQL queries, and constraining them to these tasks, users can mitigate the risk of errors. The use of deterministic software to augment LLM capabilities ensures that the results are trustworthy. This approach is exemplified by the use of SQL chatbots to drive Shiny dashboards, where the focus is on the correctness of SQL rather than the LLM’s broader capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micromanaging the Model</strong>: This involves maintaining a tight feedback loop between the user and the LLM, allowing for immediate correction of errors. By taking small, manageable steps and closely overseeing the model’s outputs, users can ensure that mistakes are caught promptly. This approach is particularly useful in data visualization, where subjectivity allows for easy judgment of outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deferred Review</strong>: In this approach, users allow the LLM to take larger steps, accumulating a “review debt” that is addressed before the final output is shared. This method offers rapid progress but requires a thorough review to ensure accuracy and reliability. Databot, Posit’s exploratory data analysis agent, exemplifies this approach by generating reproducible reports that users can review and refine.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="balancing-use-and-responsibility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balancing-use-and-responsibility">Balancing Use and Responsibility</h2>
<p>The decision on how to responsibly use LLMs depends on the specific context and the risk tolerance of the user. For instance, those working in marketing may have a higher tolerance for risk compared to individuals in fields where lives are at stake. Cheng emphasized the importance of understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and advises users to find a balance that aligns with their needs and ethical considerations.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Joe Cheng’s keynote at R+AI 2025 provided valuable insights into the responsible use of LLMs in data science and research. By focusing on principles of correctness, transparency, and reproducibility, and adopting approaches that mitigate risks, users can harness the power of LLMs to enhance their workflows while maintaining trust and reliability. Posit’s commitment to open-source software and ethical considerations serves as a strong example for the R community in navigating the evolving landscape of AI.</p>

  <title>Me, Myself, and Claude: Scaling an R Consultancy with AI-Assisted Development</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/me-myself-claude/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7uAf1Wz2gEQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<section id="slides-with-resource-links-available-here" class="level3">

<p>Large language models entered many data scientists’ lives through small conveniences: better email replies, smoother vacation planning, quick summaries of documentation. For Jasmine Daly, Principal Consultant and Founder of Daly Analytics, the next step was less comfortable: AI could write decent R code and Shiny apps. Did that make years of R experience obsolete? Was this a shortcut that would quietly erode hard-won expertise?</p>
<p>In the R+AI talk “Me, Myself, and Claude: How I Leverage AI-Assisted Development to Scale My R-Based Data Science Consultancy,” Jasmine reframes those fears into a much more productive question: how can AI become a force multiplier for R developers, not a crutch?</p>
</section>
<section id="from-vibe-coding-to-accountable-ai-assisted-development" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-vibe-coding-to-accountable-ai-assisted-development">From “vibe coding” to accountable AI-assisted development</h2>
<p>Jasmine starts with a term many R users have seen online: “vibe coding.” It captures that slightly chaotic feeling of pasting prompts into an AI, grabbing whatever comes out, and hoping it runs. It is funny—but also dangerous. The mindset behind it is essentially:</p>
<ul>
<li>try something</li>
<li>hope it works</li>
<li>do not look too closely at why</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of “vibe coding,” Jasmine prefers “intentional, accountable AI-assisted development.” The shift is not about policing language; it is about accurately describing the work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a real system being built for real organizations<br>
</li>
<li>there are real risks around correctness, maintainability, and security<br>
</li>
<li>a human developer remains responsible for design decisions and outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>For Jasmine, AI is “a new agentic tool in the toolbox,” not a replacement for R expertise. That language matters, especially inside a consultancy where clients rely on clear judgment, not just clever code.</p>
</section>
<section id="mental-bandwidth-as-the-real-bottleneck" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mental-bandwidth-as-the-real-bottleneck">Mental bandwidth as the real bottleneck</h2>
<p>As a solo consultant serving nonprofits and other mission-driven organizations, Jasmine used to spend most working hours writing code: Shiny apps, dashboards, R packages, data pipelines. The result: less time for the work that grows a sustainable practice and strengthens the R community.</p>
<p>AI-assisted development changed that balance. Instead of treating AI as “time savings on tasks already being done,” Jasmine treats it as a <strong>mental bandwidth reallocator</strong>. Offloading boilerplate and repetitive scaffolding frees attention for:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving business operations and systems<br>
</li>
<li>thinking clearly about pricing, profitability, and packaging of services<br>
</li>
<li>building relationships through networking, speaking, and community work</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, this is not about doing less technical work. Jasmine still writes R code nearly every day. The difference is that cognitive load is no longer consumed entirely by syntax and glue code; there is space for bigger-picture thinking and community contribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="turning-personal-tools-into-r-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turning-personal-tools-into-r-packages">Turning personal tools into R packages</h2>
<p>A good example of that shift is the evolution from one-off scripts to reusable packages.</p>
<section id="shinyfa-understanding-large-shiny-codebases" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shinyfa-understanding-large-shiny-codebases"><code>{shinyfa}</code>: understanding large Shiny codebases</h3>
<p>A client Shiny app with a large, unfamiliar codebase was consuming huge onboarding time. To cope, Jasmine wrote ad hoc scripts—supported by Claude Code—to analyze file structure, track <code>render*()</code> and reactive functions, and surface where important logic lived.</p>
<p>Previously, those scripts would have stayed on a local machine. With more bandwidth and AI-assisted help, Jasmine turned that exploratory tooling into a reusable R package: <strong>{shinyfa}</strong>, now on CRAN, which analyzes large Shiny directories and extracts structured information about reactivity patterns and outputs for easier onboarding and refactoring.</p>
</section>
<section id="avilistr-a-weekend-package-powered-by-curiosity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avilistr-a-weekend-package-powered-by-curiosity"><code>{avilistr}</code>: a weekend package powered by curiosity</h3>
<p>Another example came from a personal interest: bird taxonomy. Starting from an Excel file and the newly released AviList global bird checklist, Jasmine used Claude Code to help wrap the data, write documentation, and publish <strong>{avilistr}</strong>, an R package exposing the AviList global avian checklist to R users in a research-ready form.</p>
<p>The technical lift was not extreme. The point is what changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>before AI, that project would likely have stayed a “someday” idea<br>
</li>
<li>with AI-assisted development, it became a polished, documented R package released in a weekend</li>
</ul>
<p>For the R community, this is the upside: more of those “nice-to-have” tools actually get shipped.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="saying-yes-to-bigger-more-interesting-r-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="saying-yes-to-bigger-more-interesting-r-projects">Saying yes to bigger, more interesting R projects</h2>
<p>Jasmine also shows how AI changes the filter for accepting new work.</p>
<p>The old filter was purely capacity-driven:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can this be built in a reasonable timeframe?</li>
<li>With current skills?</li>
<li>Alongside existing client workload?</li>
</ul>
<p>With AI-assisted development, the filter becomes more strategic:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical build is possible.<br>
</li>
<li>The key question is: can there be deep understanding of the client’s desired outcomes, their team’s strengths, and the right “size” of solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>That change leads to more ambitious, higher-impact problems—without requiring 80-hour weeks.</p>
</section>
<section id="claude-code-as-a-senior-and-sometimes-junior-developer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="claude-code-as-a-senior-and-sometimes-junior-developer">Claude Code as a senior (and sometimes junior) developer</h2>
<p>A recurring theme in the talk is Jasmine’s mental model for working with Claude Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jasmine is the <strong>manager and technical lead</strong><br>
</li>
<li>Claude is a <strong>senior, sometimes junior, developer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That means Jasmine:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets direction and architecture<br>
</li>
<li>defines requirements in detail<br>
</li>
<li>reviews every pull request–equivalent output<br>
</li>
<li>remains in and on the loop at all times</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>being specific in prompts and requirements<br>
</li>
<li>always reviewing generated code and context files<br>
</li>
<li>using small, incremental commits to make AI changes auditable<br>
</li>
<li>feeding documentation links and relevant repos so the model has grounded context<br>
</li>
<li>sometimes asking for multiple options, then blending or choosing the simplest approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The R community takeaway: treat AI tools as part of a team that needs leadership, not as an infallible code generator.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-real-world-architecture-50-dashboards-github-actions-and-quarto" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-real-world-architecture-50-dashboards-github-actions-and-quarto">A real-world architecture: 50+ dashboards, GitHub Actions, and Quarto</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling case studies in the talk centers on a client with more than 50 dashboards that needed to scale. Jasmine describes using Claude Code to help assemble a sustainable architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions and YAML workflows to orchestrate builds<br>
</li>
<li>Railway as a virtual machine environment<br>
</li>
<li>Supabase with row-level security for multi-tenant isolation<br>
</li>
<li>Quarto dashboards, each pulling only its own data<br>
</li>
<li>A shared component library and template so features could be toggled on or off</li>
</ul>
<p>The result: “right-sized, enterprise-grade infrastructure” delivered in weeks instead of months, with Jasmine still firmly in technical control. Without AI assistance, that project might have been impractical or too risky for a solo consultant to accept.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-r-intuition-through-volume-not-shortcuts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-r-intuition-through-volume-not-shortcuts">Building R intuition through volume, not shortcuts</h2>
<p>A common fear in the R community is that relying on AI will erode skills. Jasmine’s experience is the opposite: <strong>AI increases the volume and variety of patterns seen</strong>, which, when handled deliberately, strengthens intuition.</p>
<p>She highlights three recurring categories of AI mistakes and what they teach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package confusion</strong> – e.g., misinterpreting <code>{shinyfa}</code> as related to Font Awesome. The fix is to feed documentation URLs and be explicit about which package is in use. This forces better documentation habits.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Data structure assumptions</strong> – incorrect column names or types, or confusing similar datasets. This encourages consistent use of <code>str()</code>, <code>glimpse()</code>, and other inspection tools, and can be mitigated by exposing the real R session via MCP tools so the model sees actual objects.</li>
<li><strong>Over-engineering</strong> – proposing complex graph-based or multi-package solutions where a simple <code>dplyr</code> pipeline would work. Asking for multiple options and explicitly requesting the simplest approach helps counter this tendency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each mistake becomes a prompt-engineering lesson and a design pattern lesson at the same time. Instead of avoiding errors, Jasmine leans into high-volume iteration, using failures to refine both prompts and architectural judgment.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-simple-reflection-framework-for-rai-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-simple-reflection-framework-for-rai-projects">A simple reflection framework for R+AI projects</h2>
<p>In closing, Jasmine offers a practical reflection exercise for anyone starting an AI-assisted R project:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will always be done personally?<br>
</li>
<li>What can AI help with?<br>
</li>
<li>What needs to be understood deeply?<br>
</li>
<li>What is comfortable to delegate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing down the answers before starting a project makes the human/AI division of labor explicit. It also reinforces that responsibility for correctness, ethics, and impact stays with the human developer.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-this-means-for-the-r-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-means-for-the-r-community">What this means for the R community</h2>
<p>The core message to the R community is direct: AI does not automatically make developers lazy or dependent. Used with intention, it can:</p>
<ul>
<li>unlock time for community talks, open source work, and mentoring<br>
</li>
<li>turn private scripts into packages that benefit thousands of R users<br>
</li>
<li>enable R consultants to take on more ambitious, higher-impact projects<br>
</li>
<li>accelerate learning by exposing more patterns—while still demanding human judgment</li>
</ul>
<p>Jasmine’s journey from existential dread to strategic partnership with Claude is a blueprint many R users can follow. The tools may be new, but the craft is familiar: thoughtful design, careful review, and a commitment to building software that genuinely helps people.</p>
<p>The invitation is clear: stay human-in-the-loop, build with intention, keep learning—and bring that energy back into the R community.</p>

<h1>Building GenAI Applications: Lessons from R and Python Tooling</h1>
<p>Generative AI (GenAI) has become an exciting frontier for developers and data scientists eager to infuse applications with intelligent features. The journey at A2-Ai, a team of scientists and developers skilled in languages like R, Python, JavaScript, and more, provides valuable insights into the interplay of R and Python in GenAI tooling. This post delves into key learnings and experiences from building GenAI applications, focusing on tools that enhance communication between elements and back-end systems.</p>
<section id="a-journey-into-genai-from-challenges-to-solutions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-journey-into-genai-from-challenges-to-solutions">A Journey into GenAI: From Challenges to Solutions</h2>
<p>A2-Ai’s exploration into GenAI began with a simple question: “How do I install the <code>dplyr</code> package?” While large language models like ChatGPT offered correct answers, they weren’t always applicable to internal processes. A2-Ai uses an internal tool written in Rust, called RB, for managing installations and environments for R packages. The need to incorporate such internal knowledge into a chatbot led to the development of a unique system built with Shiny for Python. The result was a chatbot capable of fetching precise information from the internal R repository, Prism, and making appropriate API calls.</p>
<p>For example, one colleague developed a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in R, enabling natural language queries for exploratory data analysis within pharmacometrics workflows. This allowed scientists to interact with data by posing questions in English, prompting updates in plots and legends.</p>
<p>While applications are diverse, three core building blocks are essential for building GenAI applications: model interface, context handling, and result validation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-building-blocks-of-genai-applications">Core Building Blocks of GenAI Applications</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Model Interface</strong>: This manages Language Model (LM) API calls. Despite the dearth of R SDKs for providers like OpenAI, the package <code>{ellmer}</code> has emerged as the go-to tool for R developers. <code>{ellmer}</code> abstracts overhead from HTTP calls, allowing developers to focus on building rather than communication intricacies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Context Handling</strong>: This involves determining the necessary context for LLMs to provide accurate responses. In enterprise environments, internal documentation, codebases, and workflows form part of this context. The robustness of the Python ecosystem, rich with tools for document processing, offers an advantage, but recent R developments are bridging some gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Result Validation</strong>: Ensuring systematic output of desired results is crucial, given the non-deterministic behavior of LM applications. Tools like <code>vital</code> in R and <code>inspect</code> in Python offer mechanisms to evaluate GenAI applications systematically, ensuring improvements are tracked and validated.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-of-tooling-in-r-and-python">Evolution of Tooling in R and Python</h2>
<p>R and Python ecosystems have evolved with various packages dealing with model interfaces. The chronological development of these packages reveals a convergence towards <code>{ellmer}</code> for R, while Python’s ecosystem remains diverse due to original SDKs from model providers and other unifying libraries.</p>
<p>The Python ecosystem boasts high-level orchestration frameworks for different use cases, a result of foundational SDKs enabling diverse and rich use-case development. While R’s ecosystem is in a growth phase, new tools are helping it catch up.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategies-for-leveraging-r-and-python-together">Strategies for Leveraging R and Python Together</h2>
<p>Developers need not choose between R and Python. Several strategies exist to leverage both:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R-Only Teams</strong>: Start with <code>{ellmer}</code> and explore packages like <code>{btw}</code> (from Posit), which allow interaction with LLMs within R environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Python-Only Tools</strong>: Use the <code>reticulate</code> package to call Python libraries and functions from R without switching languages entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multilingual Teams</strong>: Use REST APIs to expose tools to other teams, enabling interaction across different languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>: With MCP servers, developers can expose functions in any language as natural language queries, enhancing cross-language interactions.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="conclusion-and-final-takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-and-final-takeaways">Conclusion and Final Takeaways</h2>
<p>Building GenAI applications with R and Python is an exciting venture, enriched by rapidly evolving ecosystems. While Python offers maturity, R is catching up with robust tools like <code>{ellmer}</code>. The key is to start building and refine applications based on user interactions. Bridging gaps strategically through REST APIs and MCP servers ensures developers leverage the best of both worlds while being mindful of potential risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Engage with the GenAI community, share experiences, and continue learning for a rewarding journey in building innovative applications.</p>

<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is quickly becoming a core pattern for putting real-world data behind large language models (LLMs). At R+AI 2025, the session <strong>“R+AI: Use RAG from your database to gain insights into the R Consortium”</strong> put this pattern directly into the hands of R users.</p>
<p>Presented by <strong>Mark Hornick</strong> (Senior Director, Oracle Machine Learning) and <strong>Sherry LaMonica</strong> (Consulting MTS, Oracle Machine Learning), the session walks through how to turn the R Consortium’s blog archive into a searchable knowledge source using R, Oracle Autonomous AI Database, and Select AI’s built-in RAG capabilities.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="why-rag-matters-for-r-users" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-rag-matters-for-r-users">Why RAG matters for R users</h2>
<p>The session opens with a problem that every R user experimenting with LLMs has already run into: models are powerful, but their knowledge is frozen at a training cutoff date. They know a lot about R in general, but not necessarily about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent events such as R+AI 2025<br>
</li>
<li>Newly published R Consortium posts or announcements<br>
</li>
<li>Fresh community content, including RUG interviews and technical grant updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Without access to current, domain-specific content, a base LLM simply cannot answer many questions accurately—especially about a fast-moving ecosystem like R.</p>
<p>RAG solves this by combining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vector search</strong> over your own content (in this case, R Consortium blogs)<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Generative AI</strong> that uses the retrieved passages as grounded context</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of asking an LLM to “remember everything,” RAG feeds it the exact snippets it needs at query time. The model generates text, but the facts come from your data.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="inside-a-rag-pipeline-from-chunks-to-answers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inside-a-rag-pipeline-from-chunks-to-answers">Inside a RAG pipeline: from chunks to answers</h2>
<p>Hornick walks through a concise but clear mental model for RAG:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Chunk documents</strong><br>
R Consortium blog posts and related articles are split into text chunks using a sliding window approach, so each piece is big enough to be meaningful but small enough for precise retrieval.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create embeddings and a vector index</strong><br>
Each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector using an embedding (transformer) model. These vectors are stored in a vector database and organized by a <strong>vector index</strong>, which makes similarity search fast and scalable, even with millions of chunks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Embed the user query</strong><br>
When a user asks a question in natural language, that question is also converted into a vector using the same embedding model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retrieve similar chunks</strong><br>
The system performs a semantic similarity search between the query vector and the document vectors, retrieving the top-k most relevant chunks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Augment the prompt and call the LLM</strong><br>
Those chunks are combined with the user’s question to form an augmented prompt. The LLM then generates an answer grounded in the retrieved R Consortium content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Return both answer and sources</strong><br>
In addition to the natural-language answer, the system can return which documents and offsets contributed to that response, giving transparency and traceability back to the original posts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The key point: RAG injects fresh, trusted knowledge into the LLM at inference time, without retraining or fine-tuning the model.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="select-ai-and-autonomous-ai-database-rag-built-into-the-database" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="select-ai-and-autonomous-ai-database-rag-built-into-the-database">Select AI and Autonomous AI Database: RAG built into the database</h2>
<p>Rather than asking R users to handcraft all this orchestration with an external framework, the session leans on <strong>Oracle Autonomous AI Database</strong> and <strong>Select AI</strong>. In this architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>R Consortium blog archive</strong> is stored as HTML and text files in <strong>Oracle Object Storage</strong>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Select AI RAG</strong> automates chunking, embedding, vector store creation, and index maintenance inside the database.<br>
</li>
<li>The entire RAG pipeline lives close to the data, which simplifies operations and improves performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select AI exposes a configuration object called an <strong>AI profile</strong>, which specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AI provider and LLM to use (for example, an OCI Generative AI model)<br>
</li>
<li>The transformer (embedding) model<br>
</li>
<li>The vector index to query<br>
</li>
<li>Parameters like temperature, max tokens, and whether to return sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The talk shows how AI profiles become the control center for RAG: define them once, then reuse them across R sessions, workflows, and applications.</p>

</section>
<section id="building-rag-from-r-helper-functions-not-boilerplate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-rag-from-r-helper-functions-not-boilerplate">Building RAG from R: helper functions, not boilerplate</h2>
<p>From the R user’s perspective, the magic happens through a set of helper functions that wrap the underlying PL/SQL APIs in the database. LaMonica demonstrates this live from RStudio:</p>
<ul>
<li>An R function establishes a secure connection to Oracle Autonomous AI Database.<br>
</li>
<li>Another function creates an AI profile, passing in credentials, LLM configuration, and the name of the vector index.<br>
</li>
<li>A third function creates the vector index itself, handling options like chunk size, chunk overlap, and refresh behavior as new content is added to Object Storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the PL/SQL complexity—JSON attribute strings, dynamic SQL, and calls to <code>DBMS_CLOUD_AI</code> procedures such as <code>CREATE_VECTOR_INDEX</code>—is hidden behind the R wrapper functions. R users stay in familiar territory while the database takes care of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Once everything is configured, a single R function can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a natural language prompt<br>
</li>
<li>Call the appropriate Select AI procedure under the hood<br>
</li>
<li>Return both the generated answer and the list of retrieved sources as a tidy R object</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern makes it realistic for R teams to prototype and deploy RAG workflows without becoming experts in database internals.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="direct-llm-vs-rag-asking-about-rai-2025" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="direct-llm-vs-rag-asking-about-rai-2025">Direct LLM vs RAG: asking about R+AI 2025</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling moments in the demo is a simple A/B test:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, LaMonica asks a base LLM (no RAG) about the <strong>R+AI 2025 conference</strong>. As expected, the model admits it has no information—this content postdates its training data.<br>
</li>
<li>Then, she repeats the same question using RAG backed by the R Consortium blog and conference pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time, the answer includes concrete details about R+AI 2025: dates, online format, and examples from the program, all drawn from the R Consortium’s own materials.</p>
<p>The difference is stark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without RAG, the model is blind to R Consortium’s latest activities.<br>
</li>
<li>With RAG, it acts like a knowledgeable assistant that “reads” the current R Consortium site for every query.</li>
</ul>
<p>For anyone managing R content—websites, documentation, internal knowledge bases—the lesson is clear: RAG is how LLMs become truly useful on top of your own corpus.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="multilingual-retrieval-on-english-blog-content" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multilingual-retrieval-on-english-blog-content">Multilingual retrieval on English blog content</h2>
<p>Another highlight is multilingual support. The R Consortium blog posts used in the demo are in English, but the speakers show queries issued in <strong>Italian, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The multilingual embedding model interprets the query in each language.<br>
</li>
<li>The system still retrieves relevant English-language blog chunks.<br>
</li>
<li>The LLM responds in the same language as the question, grounded in English content.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an international community like the R ecosystem—where user groups and contributors span Europe, Latin America, and beyond—this multilingual RAG pattern is powerful. It makes English-only technical content accessible through conversational queries in local languages, while still keeping a single canonical source of truth.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="under-the-hood-ai-profiles-vector-indexes-and-plsql" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="under-the-hood-ai-profiles-vector-indexes-and-plsql">Under the hood: AI profiles, vector indexes, and PL/SQL</h2>
<p>Toward the end of the session, the speakers briefly peel back the abstraction and show what the R helper functions are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>PL/SQL <code>CREATE_PROFILE</code> block</strong> configures the AI profile: provider, credentials, LLM, embedding model, vector index, and parameters such as temperature and max tokens.<br>
</li>
<li>A <strong><code>CREATE_VECTOR_INDEX</code> call</strong> specifies the vector database provider (Oracle), the location in Object Storage, vector dimensionality, distance metric, and chunking options like overlap and size.<br>
</li>
<li>Other procedures drop or refresh vector indexes, and control whether sources are returned with each answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The R wrappers simply construct these PL/SQL calls as strings, execute them via a database connectivity package, and translate the results into forms that are easy to work with in R.</p>
<p>The message to R developers is not “learn PL/SQL,” but “understand that these building blocks exist and are automated for you.”</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="who-are-the-speakers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-are-the-speakers">Who are the speakers?</h2>
<p>The session is anchored by two long-time contributors at the intersection of databases, machine learning, and R:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mark Hornick</strong> is Senior Director of Product Management for Oracle Machine Learning and Select AI. He has more than 25 years of experience integrating machine learning into Oracle products and is Oracle’s representative to the R Consortium, as well as an advisor to the Analytics and Data Oracle User Community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sherry LaMonica</strong> works on Oracle’s AI and Machine Learning product management team, helping organizations integrate open-source and commercial data science tools into large-scale analytical environments. She brings decades of experience supporting data-driven innovation across industries.</p></li>

  <title>Learning Shiny, Together: A Collaborative Reading Club Around Mastering Shiny in Buenos Aires</title>

<p>Have you ever wanted to read Mastering Shiny but kept postponing it for “when things calm down”? So did we! At <a href="https://rladiesba.netlify.app/">R-Ladies Buenos Aires</a> and <a href="https://renbaires.github.io/">R en Buenos Aires</a>, many of us had Mastering Shiny sitting on our virtual shelves, always waiting for the right moment. After months (okay, maybe years) of good intentions and no progress, we realized we needed a push, and that push came from the power of community.</p>
<section id="from-solo-intentions-to-collective-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-solo-intentions-to-collective-learning">From Solo Intentions to Collective Learning</h2>
<p>There is an African proverb that says, <em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em> We decided to turn individual intentions into collective learning. Instead of trying to read the book on our own, we organized a <strong>community-based reading club</strong>: one where we could support each other, share our doubts, and celebrate our progress. Our goals were simple. We wanted to create a friendly, welcoming environment for learning Shiny, break down the book into manageable chunks, and make space for everyone, regardless of their experience, to learn and lead.</p>

<figcaption>Virtual Meeting 9: Discussion of Chapters 14 of <em>Mastering Shiny</em></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div><div class="column" style="width:60%;">
<p>We organized the club around ten meetings, which took place between March and July. Although we initially planned to read the entire book, we decided that a shorter, time-bound version would be more realistic and sustainable for the organizing team and its participants. We began planning and organizing this large-scale activity in September 2024.</p>
<p>All sessions were held online, lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. Each one was led by a different person (or pair), who walked us through the content and exercises of the assigned chapters.</p>
<p>There was no expectation of being an expert. In fact, we explicitly encouraged people with little or no prior Shiny experience to join and to lead (and they did!). The only guideline was to read the chapters, try the exercises, and come ready to share. Presenters would explain what they understood from the chapters, highlight key concepts, and guide us through the exercises. Then the magic happened: we’d collectively fill in the gaps, ask questions, offer alternatives, and learn from one another.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Most presenters created slides or notebooks to guide their sessions (though this wasn’t mandatory). We collected all those materials in this <a href="https://github.com/RLadies-BA/mastering-shiny">public GitHub repository</a>, with a variety of formats and styles. We deliberately avoided imposing a specific format as we didn’t want technical barriers to stop anyone from sharing. Eventually, we plan to curate and organize the materials to make them easier to reuse, especially for Spanish-speaking learners. We believe there’s real added value in having community-built learning materials in Spanish.</p>
<p>Over time, participants started to share the Shiny apps they were building on their own. We added a small “Show and Tell” section to the beginning of some meetings, where people presented their work-in-progress and received feedback and encouragement. It was a space full of mutual support, curiosity, and honest learning.</p>

<figcaption>Summary of the Reading Club’s Last Meeting</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Although we recorded the sessions, we decided to make them accessible only to attendees. This was different from our chapters’ usual practice, but we wanted to keep the sessions informal, comfortable, and pressure-free — more like a study group than a workshop. This allowed everyone to feel safe sharing unfinished work, asking questions, and making mistakes.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflections-and-lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflections-and-lessons-learned">Reflections and Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Throughout the series, different people volunteered to lead the sessions. These volunteers included academics and industry professionals with a variety of backgrounds and levels of experience with R. Each volunteer brought their own style and perspective to the sessions, and all of them did a fantastic job. Although a small core group participated in most sessions, many others joined according to their interests or availability.</p>
<p>We were surprised to have new community members who took advantage of the virtual format to join us from other countries and cities in Argentina. This allowed us to break down the barriers of physical presence and discuss topics of interest from different professional areas in Spanish.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, one idea for a future iteration is to organize the sessions around building a single Shiny app together. We believe this could help sustain engagement, make the learning more tangible, and give participants the chance to immediately see how the book’s concepts connect in practice.</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of the book club was hearing what participants took away from the experience. Beyond Shiny itself, people highlighted the joy of learning together, the responsibility of having regular meetings, and the warmth of the community. By the end of the club, several participants left feeling motivated and thinking of strategies to improve their work by creating a Shiny app or exploring a topic to take their first steps with a dashboard.</p>

<p>This reading club wasn’t just about working through a technical book. It was about carving out time for learning, growing confidence, building apps (and community!), and showing that you don’t need to know everything to lead or participate.

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/sovereign-tech-fund-invests-450000-in-r-foundation-to-enhance-r-sustainability-and-security/Rlogo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The R ecosystem, a cornerstone of statistical computing and data science, is poised for significant enhancements in its long-term health and security. With a new investment of USD $450,000 (€392,000) from the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/r-project">Sovereign Tech Fund (STF)</a>, the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/">R Foundation</a> is embarking on a crucial project to modernize R’s core infrastructure, improve its maintainability, and fortify its supply chain.</p>
<p>This initiative is championed by the R Foundation and the R Core Team. The R Foundation is a not-for-profit organization providing crucial financial and logistical support for the R project. Established by the members of the R Core Team, its primary mission is to ensure the continued success and stability of R for the global community. The Foundation, based in Vienna, Austria, holds the copyright for R software and uses its resources to support development and foster innovation in statistical computing. The R Core Team is the dedicated group of developers with write access to the R source code, who volunteer their time to guide the technical evolution of the language.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/sovereign-tech-fund-invests-450000-in-r-foundation-to-enhance-r-sustainability-and-security/urbanek.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>To understand the impact of this grant, we sat down with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-urbanek-08b973106/?originalSubdomain=nz">Simon Urbanek</a>, a key member of the R Core Team and an Associate Professor in Statistics at the University of Auckland. Simon shared his insights on what this funding means for the future of R and how the community can play a part.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>R Consortium: What core problem or opportunity does the commissioned work from the Sovereign Tech Fund help the R Foundation address?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> The main reason we are spearheading this effort is to increase the sustainability and maintainability of the R project. Sustainability, in the sense of making sure that the R codebase itself can be maintained long into the future, ensuring we have continuity and making that process easier.</p>
<p>This investment also helps us address increasing concerns around software supply chain security. This has to do with provenance and reliability—ensuring that users can be assured that a particular piece of software comes from the right source. This involves initiatives like signing sources and binaries to verify their origin.</p>
<p>Finally, a key component is reproducibility. We want to ensure that analyses and results can be reproduced reliably, both by the original authors and by others in the community.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: You mentioned provenance and the need for verification. Is this being driven by new regulations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> Not directly by regulation, no. This is more of a proactive measure. Given the age of the R project, our distribution model has traditionally been a central repository where people can simply download files. While this has served us well, the open-source world has seen various security issues, making it clear that we need better ways to verify that software comes from a trusted source.</p>
<p>We already have binary signing for R itself on macOS and Windows, but this hasn’t been extended to packages. It’s an important step to take. While it’s not clear if platforms like Microsoft will officially require it, there are indications they may. We want to prepare for that possibility and strengthen the security of the ecosystem, especially for a central distribution hub like CRAN.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: Why is tackling this problem now timely for the R ecosystem and the wider open-source community?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> R has been around for over 25 years and has become part of the fabric of data analytics and statistical analysis in government, academia, and commercial entities. With this level of adoption, it’s critical that we can sustain the maintenance of R to support its community. The purely volunteer-driven effort that got us here may not be sufficient to address the increasing complexities and threats we see today.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: What tangible deliverables can the community expect, and on what timeline?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> The main improvements will be within R itself, and some may be under the hood. Deliverables include replacing legacy code and older third-party projects that were integrated into R for historical reasons. This will make R more maintainable, as we won’t have to oversee unmaintained code.</p>
<p>We are also focused on making it easier to port R to new platforms, such as the Windows ARM platform. Other improvements will be more visible to developers, including enhanced documentation and better tooling, with the goal of making it easier for new people to contribute to R.</p>
<p>The work is expected to take place over the next 18 months. We hope that the foundations we lay during this project will carry over and continue to be useful long after the project officially concludes.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: Who are the key people and teams involved in this initiative?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> A significant portion of the technical work—including bug triage, platform improvements, and replacing old infrastructure—will be done by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalibera/?originalSubdomain=cz">Tomas Kalibera</a>. As a member of the R Core Team, Tomas is one of the most active developers of the R interpreter, and his deep expertise in R’s internals and build systems makes him uniquely suited to lead the modernization of R’s core. This grant provides vital support for him to dedicate his time to these foundational improvements that are critical for R’s long-term health.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/sovereign-tech-fund-invests-450000-in-r-foundation-to-enhance-r-sustainability-and-security/kalibera.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Other efforts, especially around documentation and community engagement, will be led by various R Core members. This entire project was conceived with the help of the R Foundation board members, and we also hope to collaborate with the R Consortium to bring in more contributors from the community.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: What makes the Sovereign Tech Fund a uniquely suitable partner for this initiative?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> The Sovereign Tech Fund is a really good match because its mission is perfectly aligned with our needs. Their main focus is on sustainability for open-source software and strengthening digital public infrastructure, which is exactly our primary concern at the moment. We want to ensure R’s development is sustainable and that the community itself can support it without having to rely on commercial partners.</p>
<p>This investment allows us to modernize the codebase to make it easier to maintain and, at the same time, build resources to encourage more community contributions.</p>
<p><strong>R Consortium: How can the R community get involved and contribute to this effort?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon Urbanek:</strong> There are many ways for the community to get involved. People can definitely provide feedback, especially as we add new user-facing features and create new documentation. We need to know if these resources are truly making it easier for the community to contribute.</p>
<p>Another area is bug triage. We aim to reduce the number of pending bugs, especially older ones, to make the bug tracker less overwhelming. The community can help identify and work on important issues.</p>
<p>Finally, we will need help with testing. This is true for improvements in R itself and for new infrastructure related to packages, such as containerized checks for reproducibility and the adoption of code signing. The community’s participation in testing, providing feedback, and adopting these new practices will be invaluable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vboned/">Vicent Boned</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-eixarch/">Marc Eixarch</a>, organizers of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-finland/">R User Group Finland</a>, spoke with the R Consortium about how they revived the local R community by focusing on fun, practical applications of R. Drawing on their experience from Barcelona’s tech scene, they took over an inactive R group and began hosting engaging meetups focused on real-world applications of R. From building custom Spotify Wrapped-style reports to analyzing Helsinki’s real estate market, they’ve created a meetup environment where data enthusiasts can explore R through real-world use cases that go beyond the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> I’m a data analyst. I first learned R in university and used it for 10 to 12 years. We used to live in Barcelona, a large city with a very active tech community. We were involved with the R user group and another popular meetup called Data Beers. It’s still running, but we’ve attended many of those events and enjoyed them.</p>
<p>When we moved to Finland, I began searching for similar community activities, but I couldn’t find many. I found a meetup group, but it was inactive, so I reached out to the organizer. He told me he had moved out of Helsinki and was happy to pass on the group’s organization to someone new. That’s how we took over the R user group in Finland. We’re not Finnish, but now we’re working to organize events here and stay connected with other data analysts.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-your-level-of-experience-with-the-r-language">What’s your level of experience with the R language?</h2>
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> I first encountered R in a university stats course, but I started working with it seriously once I became a data analyst. I’ve been in this role for approximately six or seven years, with a primary focus on data analysis. I work extensively with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot</a> for data visualization, preparation, and gathering data from various sources, such as APIs and databases. That’s my main strength in R.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I take on small projects to explore more technical areas, such as package development, but in those areas, I’m more of a casual user than an expert. So, that’s a good summary of my experience level.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/spotify-stats-and-real-estate-insights-r-user-group-finland-builds-practical-projects/MarcExirach.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> I’ve used R throughout my career, mainly for data analysis and visualization. While I’ve explored other packages through side projects, my current work primarily revolves around tidyverse, ggplot, and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> for tables and reporting. At my company, we also utilize some Posit tools, such as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>, and occasionally Shiny for prototyping.</p>
<p>I used Shiny years ago in my second job when it was a new package. I didn’t work with it for many years after that, so it’s been exciting to see how much it has evolved. I’ve also attended several RStudio conferences, and it has been great to follow the development of the Tidyverse over time.</p>

What is the goal/reason, result, or anything interesting related to your industry?</h2>
<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> At work, I use R for almost everything. I work for a gaming company, so my job involves analyzing user behavior and understanding how they interact with the app. This involves a significant amount of data exploration and visualization, as we have a wealth of data on nearly every action users take in the game. I often present my findings to non-technical team members, so I use R to create reports and presentations with Quarto, which I then share with the team. Your day-to-day work looks quite similar!</p>
<p>Recently—or, to be more precise, last year—I worked on a side project while searching for an apartment to buy in Helsinki. I used R to explore the real estate market, gathering data over a few months to track trends. I built a small tool to filter listings based on different criteria, which was helpful for my search.</p>
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> I’ve worked on a few small side projects, usually based on things I’m curious about or enjoy. I’m really into music, and one time, I discovered an API that lets you access Spotify data using R. With it, you can pull public data from Spotify and even create your own “Spotify Wrapped” experience. I liked this use case so much that I turned it into a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-finland/events/291613918/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">workshop</a> for one of our events. I prepared a tutorial and shared the code in advance, and then about 10–15 of us walked through it together. Everyone can input their username to customize the script, which displays their top artists, playlist vibe, or other insights based on their Spotify data.</p>
<p>We have posted the project on GitHub, making it available for anyone to review. It was especially noteworthy because one attendee, Antti, took the project a step further by expanding it into a web application. He added functionality that allows you to type in something like “sad, melancholic metal,” which suggests a fitting band or song. He got creative; we even got permission to share the app link. It was one of my favorite projects to see grow beyond the workshop! <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spotifyr/index.html">{spotifyr} on CRAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr">on GitHub</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekaterina-akimova-7727801a6/">Ekaterina Akimova-Höpner</a>, founder of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-salzburg/">R-Ladies Salzburg</a> chapter, recently spoke with the R Consortium about using R to support cutting-edge cancer research and building a local R community in Austria. Ekaterina shared how she uses R for data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualizing high-dimensional genomic datasets. She discussed the launch of R-Ladies Salzburg in 2024, the importance of hands-on workshops for early-career researchers, and how scientific collaboration continues to shape her approach to community building. She also highlighted her talk last year at the useR! Conference 2024, where she presented tools for reproducible research in biomedical science.</p>

<p>I come from a background in medical biology, with a strong focus on cancer research. I completed my PhD at the University of Salzburg, where I investigated tumor genetics and immune evasion mechanisms, particularly in leukemia, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Initially, my work was purely wet lab-based, but it quickly evolved into a combination of both experimental and computational biology. This dual focus naturally led me to the R programming environment, which has become an essential part of my daily work.</p>
<p>During my doctoral studies, I started using R for statistical analysis and data visualization. As my projects became more complex and my research questions grew more intricate, I began building pipelines and analysis workflows in R, utilizing packages from Bioconductor, Tidyverse, and various other resources.</p>
<p>My passion for the language and the broader community grew as I discovered the power and accessibility of the R environment. This enthusiasm ultimately led me to establish the R-Ladies Salzburg chapter last year, in 2024, as there were no local user groups in the area.</p>
<p>At that time, it felt right to organize a group explicitly focused on supporting gender minorities in tech and science. I noticed a significant gap in the community that I was eager to fill. Establishing this chapter provided me with the invaluable opportunity to create an inclusive space for women in the science and data science communities in Salzburg.</p>
<p>In our first year, 2024, I planned and organized four meetups, ranging from beginner R workshops to networking events. During this time, I connected with members and organizers from all over the world, which was an enriching experience. I was fortunate to be involved in organizing last year’s useR! conference, which took place in Salzburg. One of my most rewarding moments was presenting my R package, which is in development for analyzing amplicon sequence data. I was honored to receive the Best Poster award, and the positive feedback I received strengthened my desire to give back to the community and support others on their R journey.</p>

<p>Being part of the R-Ladies global community has broadened my horizons, and I have improved my public speaking, mentorship, and event organization skills.</p>

<p>R is actively used in various fields, particularly in academia and banking. While there are several user groups in Austria, they are mainly concentrated in the eastern part of the country, with Salzburg having a smaller presence. For instance, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/viennar/">Vienna R User Group</a>, along with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-vienna/">R-Ladies Vienna</a>, represents a large community with which I’ve had the pleasure of connecting. However, organizing in-person events in the western region, particularly in Salzburg, is still a challenge. I see an opportunity to facilitate in-person meetings for those living in this area, helping to grow the local community.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-challenges-have-you-faced-in-organizing-the-group">What challenges have you faced in organizing the group?</h2>
<p>The first challenge we faced was working with the Meetup platform, which is the tool of choice for R user group meetups. It isn’t very well established, so not many people are familiar with it. In addition to Meetup, we also use Slack and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/r-ladies-salzburg/">LinkedIn</a> for communication. While Meetup does send notifications to those who sign up, it is challenging to reach a new audience through it. Therefore, enhancing our presence on LinkedIn will help ensure that more people are aware of our events.</p>

Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?</h2>
<p>Let me share my project on detecting complex rearrangements in next-generation sequencing data. The project aims to create a tool for detecting and characterizing complex genomic rearrangements, specifically templated sequence insertions, duplications, and inversions, using next-generation sequencing data. Previous studies have demonstrated that aberrant DNA double-strand break repair is a common feature in various types of cancer. In our earlier research, we discovered that these breaks can lead to genomic alterations that are not captured by standard variant-calling tools currently in use. For instance, we found evidence that high intracellular dNTP levels, observed in SAMHD1-deficient cells, promote increased templated sequence insertions.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/how-r-powers-cancer-research-and-community-teaching-in-austria/NGSDataProject.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>To quantify and characterize these events, we needed a pipeline capable of handling these datasets and performing filtering, characterization, and visualization. I chose to use R for this task because I felt more confident programming in R at the time. I developed an R-based pipeline utilizing packages from Bioconductor, including <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html">IRanges</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html">GenomicRanges</a>, along with base R and the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>The package takes over after the initial preprocessing steps of sequencing data, which include trimming, stitching, and BLAST alignment. It processes data downstream to detect sequence aberrations directly from FASTQ sequences or BLAST results, depending on what the research requires. One of the key features of our pipeline is the self-comparison metrics algorithm, which identifies internal duplications within the sequence reads.</p>
<p>Currently, the project isn’t widely available on the market, but it is in progress. Parts of it have been published, and we are using the packages internally at the institute. The goal is to submit it to <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> once it is fully completed, and we are nearing that finish line.</p>
<p>This project primarily aimed to answer our main research question, and we successfully achieved this goal. We applied the same pipeline to other projects to address similar questions, focusing on how to significantly reduce the frequency of duplications while suggesting a novel role of a specific protein in maintaining genomic stability. The clinical relevance of these findings will be determined through future studies.</p>
<p>This project has significantly expanded my understanding of genomic structures and the approach to addressing these questions through programming. It has enabled me to visualize and filter out genomic aberrations, thereby clarifying biologically relevant findings.</p>

<p>My main current project marks my first step into self-employment, leveraging my expertise in academic research, biomedicine, and data science, with a focus on consulting and science education. A significant aspect of this project involves teaching data literacy and programming, particularly using R, to complete beginners, including those from non-technical backgrounds such as the humanities, social sciences, and creative disciplines. I’m currently developing a course for absolute beginners, designed to demystify data tools and help learners build confidence through hands-on, approachable content.</p>
<p>What makes this project meaningful to me is that I’m not just teaching code, I’m guiding people through the anxiety of starting something new, helping them see that they don’t have to be math geniuses or seasoned programmers to understand data. I aim to help people feel empowered, not intimidated, by the world of data.</p>
<p>To complement this technical side, I’m also working on a course called “Mindful Doctorate,” which addresses the emotional challenges of doing a PhD. It’s based on my own academic experiences and the conversations I’ve had with peers. Many doctoral candidates struggle silently with imposter syndrome or isolation. This course will offer practical strategies for navigating that journey with greater mental clarity.</p>
<p>The common thread is to bridge technical knowledge with human communication and resilience. Learning should not only make you smarter, but also stronger and more self-aware.</p>
<p>Long-term, this will evolve into a hybrid offering, comprising online courses, live workshops, community-based projects, and one-on-one mentoring or consulting in research workflows. I’m particularly interested in collaborating with clients or institutions that aim to integrate data skills into interdisciplinary settings.</p>
<p>To summarize, my ongoing project primarily focuses on helping people find ways to realize their ideas or research objectives and to understand their data. So, whether you are analyzing a complex dataset, managing a project in the wet lab, or searching for a novel solution, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, and I’d be happy to chat.</p>

  <title>R Loves Math: cpp11armadillo connects R with Armadillo C++ linear algebra library, prioritizes prioritize safety over speed</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The R Consortium recently spoke with Mauricio “Pachá” Vargas Sepúlveda, a PhD student in Economics at the University of Surrey and the developer behind <strong>cpp11armadillo</strong>, a package funded through the R Consortium’s ISC grant program. cpp11armadillo connects R with the Armadillo C++ linear algebra library through the modern cpp11 interface, providing developers with safer, more flexible tools for computationally intensive work.</p>
<p>The R Consortium has provided grants to Pachá two different times, including <a href="https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2024-group-2.html#cpp11armadillo-an-armadillo-interface-c">most recently in late 2024</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-loves-math-cpp11armadillo-connects-r-with-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-library-prioritizes-prioritize-safety-over-speed/pacha.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<p>In this interview, conducted by email, Pachá discussed the current state of the project, the balance between safety and performance, and the kinds of features that make cpp11armadillo especially useful compared to other approaches. He also shared insights on future development priorities and reflected on his experience working with the R Consortium grant process.</p>
<p>The conversation highlights both the technical progress of cpp11armadillo and the value of community support in driving open-source innovation within the R ecosystem.</p>
<section id="what-is-the-current-development-status-of-cpp11armadillo-and-is-the-speed-optimized-version-you-mentioned-in-the-proposal-already-available-for-testing" class="level3">

<p><em>cpp11armadillo</em> has reached a stable stage according to the Tidyverse’s lifecycle. This means I am happy with the interface, I do not see major issues, and it reached a point where I was happy to share it with others. The current CRAN version is 0.5.4 and is available here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11armadillo">https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11armadillo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-loves-math-cpp11armadillo-connects-r-with-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-library-prioritizes-prioritize-safety-over-speed/cpp11armadillo_logo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>At the present time I have a testing branch on my local git tree, it requires further work (lots of work, actually), and it aims at obtaining a (much) better speed to convert from R to Armadillo data types and vice versa. <em>cpp11armadillo</em> followed this premise from Don Knuth: “premature optimization is the root of all evil.” I tried to make sure to write a comprehensive list of unit tests and prioritize safety over speed (e.g., if we convert R’s integers to C++ unsigned integers we need to be careful about negative values and check bounds to avoid undefined behaviours).</p>

<p>We currently support most Armadillo functions, as we covered with examples in the <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/">official documentation</a>. Some functions require dedicated wrappers for them, as it is the case of Armadillo’s <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/articles/statistics-and-clustering.html?q=pca#princomp">Principal Component Analysis</a>. Because R already provides a PCA function, we focused on supporting sparse matrices and expanding on different functions such as the <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/articles/signal-and-image-processing.html#fft-ifft-2">Fast Fourier Transform</a></p>

<p>Both use the same underlying library. The main difference is that cpp11armadillo is slightly faster with the default configuration, which is not as important because we can compile against OpenBLAS or other optimised linear algebra libraries. The main advantage of cpp11armadillo over RcppArmadillo is that we offer a vendoring feature, which allows the user to copy all of cpp11armadillo codebase into an R package, eliminating the dependency requirement, allowing to use a snapshotted version of the code for replication purposes, and it facilitates running code routines in restricted environments (such as servers or clusters with restricted internet access).</p>

<p>Future versions plan to offer a much better copy of complex numbers that right now we import back into C++ using lists because of a limitation in the underlying cpp11 package codebase. We already sent a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/427">few Pull Requests to add complex numbers support in cpp11</a>, plus a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/428">few fixed bugs affecting attributes for matrices</a>, adding the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/437">code to export C++ ordered and unordered maps to R lists</a>, and a few other features and bug fixes.</p>

<p>It has been a great experience. My first proposal was accepted, which allowed me to create a first stable version, and then the second proposal was rejected over totally valid concerns about coordination between cpp11 (maintained by Posit, formerly RStudio) and cpp11armadillo development. For a third proposal I obtained funding again after reading the feedback carefully and focusing exclusively on the internal package development instead of uncertain upstream changes.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliasilge/">Julia Silge</a>, co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/">Salt Lake City R User Group</a>, recently talked to the R Consortium about sustaining an active R community in a region without a central tech hub. Julia shared how she discovered R and became deeply engaged with its open-source ecosystem. She discussed the group’s dual-format meetups, which include remote talks streamed via YouTube and quarterly in-person gatherings, as well as efforts to make the community inclusive for both local professionals and a wider audience. She also highlighted a recent session on advanced Git practices and an upcoming talk on sparse data structures in the tidymodels framework.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p>My academic background is in physics and astronomy. About ten years ago, I transitioned from a more academic career into data science, and that’s when I first discovered R. I wasn’t very familiar with it; I had only heard about it in passing. The aspects of R that immediately appealed to me were its functional approach to data analysis and its programming style, which has a Lispy flavor.</p>
<p>The R community played a significant role in my identifying it as a tool that was a good fit for me. This included engaging with the open-source community and contributing to open-source projects early in my R journey. Additionally, I became connected with groups such as R-Ladies, although there isn’t an R-Ladies chapter in my local city. I started attending a local RUG meetup around ten years ago in my town.</p>
<p>My city is a smaller US city—it’s not on the coasts and doesn’t have a large tech scene like the Bay Area. Finding people here to connect with and discuss our work was incredibly valuable for me.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-salt-lake-city">Can you share what the R community is like in Salt Lake City?</h2>
<p>Our city is significantly influenced by the presence of a large university, which serves as a significant hub for research, especially in the life sciences. A substantial number of people associated with the university contribute to the local community. Additionally, outside of the university, professionals work at healthcare systems, including the VA hospital, which serve the entire region.</p>
<p>Several life science startups in the area focus on drug discovery and other health science initiatives. Many individuals involved in these startups have university backgrounds, although they are no longer directly affiliated with their respective institutions. The use of R programming is quite prevalent in these environments.</p>
<p>Overall, our community is shaped not only by those engaged in pure research but also by entrepreneurs and professionals who apply their knowledge, especially in the field of health sciences, creating a dynamic intersection between academia and industry.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-host-online-or-in-person-meetups">Do you host online or in-person meetups?</h2>
<p>We try to have a meeting most months, although we slow down a bit during the summer. There are two types of meetings we hold. The first type features a speaker who gives a talk. Since the pandemic began, we have been hosting these talks remotely via Zoom, rather than in person. We’ve found that this format works very well, allowing us to connect with people from all over, not just those in the Salt Lake area.</p>
<p>These meetings are scheduled during lunchtime in our local time zone, allowing those of us in the area to take a break from work and join in to hear and learn about various topics. For our attendees in European time zones, the talks take place in the evening, which has worked out nicely.</p>
<p>The second type of meeting we have is an in-person gathering that occurs about once a quarter. There isn’t a speaker for these events; instead, we focus on networking and casual conversations about what everyone is working on. These in-person meetings are only for residents of our city.</p>
<p>Overall, this balance is working well for us. The online talks, which are also streamed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@slcrug/streams">YouTube</a>, make it easy for people to watch later if they’re interested. You can find all our recent discussions under the “Live” section on our channel. Meanwhile, the in-person meetings allow for valuable face-to-face interactions among local attendees.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-redd-202b5736/">Andrew Redd</a> and I are the only ones involved in organizing. We’ve had a few other people who have joined at various times but ultimately stepped away. Andrew was part of the team before I joined, back when he was at the university. Initially, our meetings took place on campus, but that posed challenges for those who didn’t work at the university. It was difficult to navigate, especially for newcomers who weren’t familiar with where to go and where to park.</p>
<p>About seven or eight years ago, we decided to switch to using Meetup, allowing us to meet in different locations around the city that are more accessible for those who work downtown or aren’t on campus all day. I started helping with organizing the events around the same time.</p>
<p>We’ve done reasonably well in terms of consistency, although we don’t have events every single month. We typically aim for most months, although we often take December and January off and slow down a bit in the summer. We strive to host either a talk or a networking event during those months, providing an opportunity for us to get together and connect.</p>

<p>Recently, we held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEAEvcnA9Hs">meetup in May</a>, with our primary focus on improving <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/events/304955799/">Git practices</a>. We often find ourselves familiar only with the basic commands in Git—such as committing, pushing, and pulling—but there’s much more we can learn. The talk centered on enhancing our Git skills and strategies for troubleshooting difficult situations, which is something many of us struggle with.</p>
<p>The session was well-attended, and participants appreciated the practical skills shared during the event. It was a great example of how our group aims to provide applied knowledge that is genuinely useful.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we have another exciting talk scheduled for the end of July. This presentation will delve into how we think about our data, specifically concerning data structures. We’ll explore the concept of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/events/307528267/">sparse data structures</a>, which are particularly common in machine learning contexts.</p>
<p>For instance, with text data, certain words are used frequently while many others appear only a few times. This creates sparse data structures, where the majority of elements in a matrix are zero. Often, we don’t consider how our data is represented, but understanding this is crucial.</p>
<p>This upcoming talk will explain how sparse data structures are integrated into the tidymodels framework, emphasizing the efficiency gains that can be achieved. By using sparse data structures, we can handle larger models that might otherwise be impossible to train on a standard computer due to memory constraints. I’m looking forward to this informative session!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="any-techniques-you-recommend-using-for-planning-for-or-during-the-event-github-zoom-other-can-these-techniques-be-used-to-make-your-group-more-inclusive-to-people-that-are-unable-to-attend-physical-events-in-the-future">Any techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?</h2>
<p>A good approach for us is to block out time for planning. Instead of trying to plan every single month, we can dedicate time to creating a plan that covers the next four or five months. We always strive to highlight local speakers from the Salt Lake area, but not all of our speakers are local. So, we’ll consider who from our community has done something interesting recently.</p>
<p>Additionally, we keep an eye out for interesting blog posts that inspire potential speakers. Our group is very friendly and open, providing an excellent opportunity for members to present initial versions of talks they’re working on. If someone has a critical conference approaching, we often invite them to give a practice version of their presentation here before they present at a larger event. This setup is beneficial for both our group and the speaker.</p>
<p>We also stream our presentations on YouTube, making it easy for speakers to have a video link of their talk. If someone has a blog post they’ve created, we can help them by providing a video version of their work to share with their audience.</p>
<p>To sum up, some helpful techniques we use include planning for four to five months at a time, sending out emails to potential speakers, and considering topics based on our work or interesting discussions we’ve had. Lastly, we aim to find individuals who could benefit from practice opportunities or who want to share their work. These are some of the techniques we employ.</p>

Rafael Pereira, head of Data at Ipea, the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, a federal government institution (man in glasses). He’s the creator of packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geobr/vignettes/intro_to_geobr.html">geobr</a>, <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/censobr/index.html">censobr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geocodebr/index.html">geocodebr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flightsbr/vignettes/intro_flightsbr.html">flightsbr</a> and many more, and Carol Moreno, Abraji Director (woman in peacock sweater).</p>
<p>From Carol:</p>
<p>“A quick summary: we have over 30 people taking place in our sessions and had great feedback. And I was really happy to see that people who took the introductory sessions last year (the ones that take place in the morning) came back this year in the afternoon to catch Rafael’s session. One of them is an investigative journalist who said that, after learning R last year, he took some more courses online and began practicing, and is now using R to produce news stories and interested in learning more and more!”</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST</p>
<p>The <a href="https://abraji.org.br/english">Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji)</a>’s annual international congress will take place on July 10th-13th in São Paulo, Brazil. And the final day is dedicated to data. Traditionally called “Domingo de Dados” (Data Sunday), it’s a full day for journalist professionals and students from all over the country to take part in seven simultaneous labs with workshops and panels and learn new skills to apply data science in their investigations and coverage.</p>
<p>One of the labs will be entirely dedicated to teaching R. Participants will spend the morning in an introductory session to R led by R-Ladies São Paulo volunteer instructors and TAs, especially designed for statistical analysis considering the specifics of journalism and using Brazilian electoral data.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/teaching-r-to-investigative-journalists-in-brazil/data-sunday-2024.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the afternoon, they will learn how to use the R packages <code>censobr</code> and <code>geobr</code>, two o f the most used ones for Brazilian census and geospatial data. The workshop will be given by Rafael Pereira, Chief of Data for Ipea, the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, who created both packages. They will also get to practice the new skills and interview official government databases to try and find news stories, with the help of the instructors.</p>
<p>Because of its proximity to statistical analysis, R is one of the languages chosen by journalists on their first steps in acquiring data science skills to take their investigative work to a higher level. The investment in their training brings invaluable results in the form of news articles that expose detrimental public policies, fraud and other risks to our democracy, helping hold governments accountable and reduce social and economic inequality.</p>

<p>For the second consecutive year, R Consortium is one of the partners at the Abraji International Congress. In its 20th edition, it has become the largest journalists event in Brazil, gathering over 1,800 participants in the four days of activities.</p>
