<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simplifying-bootstrap-inference-in-r-with-the-boot.pval-package">Simplifying Bootstrap Inference in R with the boot.pval Package</h3>
<p>In the realm of statistical analysis, ensuring the reliability of p-values and confidence intervals is paramount, especially when classical assumptions about data distribution do not hold. This is where bootstrap methods come into play, offering a robust alternative by relying on data-driven, empirical distributions rather than theoretical assumptions. Despite their utility, bootstrap methods are often underutilized due to perceived complexities in implementation. However, with advancements in R packages like <code>boot.pval</code>, bootstrap inference has become more accessible than ever.</p>
<section id="the-bootstrap-approach" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bootstrap-approach">The Bootstrap Approach</h4>
<p>Introduced by Bradley Efron in 1979, the bootstrap method revolutionizes statistical inference by focusing on the empirical distribution of the data itself. Unlike traditional methods that start with a distributional assumption (e.g., normality), bootstrap methods begin with the actual data distribution. By resampling from this empirical distribution and calculating the test statistic repeatedly, we obtain an accurate approximation of its distribution. This allows for the computation of p-values and confidence intervals without reliance on stringent assumptions about data normality.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-application-a-case-study">Practical Application: A Case Study</h4>
<p>Using the sleep dataset in R, Thulin demonstrates how to replace a classic t-test with a bootstrap t-test using <code>boot.pval</code>. This approach not only simplifies the code but also enhances the robustness of the test against non-normal data distributions. The output from <code>boot.pval</code> mirrors that from traditional tests but is derived from a more reliable, data-centric approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="extending-beyond-simple-tests" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extending-beyond-simple-tests">Extending Beyond Simple Tests</h4>
<p>The <code>boot.pval</code> package is not limited to simple t-tests; it supports complex models including linear regressions and survival models. By fitting a model using standard R functions like <code>lm()</code> or <code>glm()</code>, users can then apply <code>boot.summary()</code> from <code>boot.pval</code> to obtain detailed summaries including estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values—all bootstrapped for enhanced reliability.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Bootstrap methods provide a powerful tool for statistical inference when traditional assumptions do not hold. With packages like <code>boot.pval</code>, R users can integrate robust bootstrap techniques into their daily analysis workflows effortlessly. Whether dealing with straightforward comparisons or complex multivariable models, <code>boot.pval</code> offers a user-friendly yet powerful solution for making informed statistical decisions based on solid empirical evidence.</p>
<p>For those interested in delving deeper into bootstrap methods or seeking practical applications within R, exploring further resources such as <a href="https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/">Thulin’s book “Modern Statistics with R”</a> or foundational texts on bootstrap methodology can be incredibly beneficial.</p>

<section id="ethical-choices-in-regression-analysis-a-case-study-from-seattle-childrens-hospital" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-choices-in-regression-analysis-a-case-study-from-seattle-childrens-hospital">Ethical Choices in Regression Analysis: A Case Study from Seattle Children’s Hospital</h2>
<p>In the world of statistical modeling, the choice of coding schemes for categorical variables is not merely a technical consideration but a decision laden with ethical implications. This was the focus of a recent presentation during the R/Medicine 2025 conference by Dwight Barry, Principal Data Scientist at Seattle Children’s Hospital, and Nicole Chicoine, DO, MPH, also at Seattle Children’s Hospital. The talk revolved around how these choices can influence the inferences drawn from regression analyses and ultimately impact healthcare delivery and research.</p>
<section id="the-hospitals-language-diversity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hospitals-language-diversity">The Hospital’s Language Diversity</h3>
<p>Seattle Children’s Hospital is a bustling 400-bed facility that handles over half a million patient visits annually. With such a diverse patient base, the hospital encounters more than 130 languages, with Spanish being the most common after English. To accommodate this linguistic diversity, the hospital has initiated its first all-Spanish speaking operating room, ensuring equitable care for non-English speaking patients. This commitment to inclusivity is mirrored in their research methodologies, where the focus is on equitable outcomes across different patient groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="understanding-coding-schemes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-coding-schemes">Understanding Coding Schemes</h3>
<p>The choice of coding schemes in regression models is crucial as it can shape the conclusions drawn from the data. Barry highlighted three coding schemes used in R: treatment contrast, sum contrast, and weighted effect coding. Each scheme presents categorical variables in different ways, affecting the interpretation of the data.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Treatment Contrast</strong>: This is the default coding in R, where one category is used as a reference against which others are compared. In a clinical setting, this could inadvertently privilege a particular group, often aligning with the English-speaking, white demographic, which can skew the narrative towards existing inequities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sum Contrast</strong>: Here, the grand mean of all categories is used as the reference point. This approach decouples any single category from being the norm, promoting a more balanced view. In the context of healthcare, it shifts the focus from a single dominant group to an aggregate understanding, which can be crucial in addressing biases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weighted Effect Coding</strong>: This method is a variant of the sum contrast, where each category level is weighted by its sample size. Although not a built-in feature in base R, the <code>wec</code> package facilitates its implementation. This approach provides a nuanced view by factoring in the prevalence of each category, which can be especially useful in diverse patient populations.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implications-for-healthcare-research" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-healthcare-research">Implications for Healthcare Research</h3>
<p>The choice of coding scheme is not just a statistical decision but an ethical one, as it affects how healthcare equity is perceived and addressed. Barry’s presentation underscored that while odds ratios may differ across coding schemes, the marginal effects remain consistent, suggesting that predictions are unaffected by these choices. However, the ethical ramifications are significant, as they influence which group is centered in the analysis.</p>
<p>In healthcare research, where categorical exposures like language group, race, or ethnicity lack a natural order, choosing the right coding scheme is vital. Sum contrasts, for instance, provide a means to avoid privileging any group, thereby promoting equity.</p>
</section>
<section id="broader-implications-and-recommendations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="broader-implications-and-recommendations">Broader Implications and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Barry’s insights extend beyond surgery to any healthcare condition where equity is a concern. The presentation emphasized the importance of presenting marginal effects alongside regression coefficients or odds ratios to provide a comprehensive view of the data. By decentering from a single reference point, researchers can challenge the dominant social narratives and highlight systemic inequities, paving the way for more inclusive and equitable healthcare practices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ethical dimensions of statistical modeling are as crucial as the statistical ones. As healthcare becomes increasingly data-driven, recognizing and addressing these ethical considerations is essential. By adopting coding schemes that promote equity, researchers and healthcare providers can ensure that their work contributes to a more just and equitable healthcare system.</p>

<section id="breaking-through-memory-limitations-in-redcap-introducing-the-redquack-package" class="level1">
<h1>Breaking Through Memory Limitations in REDCap: Introducing the {redquack} Package</h1>
<p>In today’s data-driven healthcare environment, managing large datasets efficiently is crucial. The REDCap platform, a free electronic health record software, is widely used by over 7,000 institutions across the globe. Its ability to handle complex, longitudinal data and support multiple instruments or assessments makes it a favored choice for clinical research. However, with the exponential growth of data, researchers often encounter memory constraints when trying to extract and analyze vast amounts of information.</p>
<p>Dylan Pieper from the University of Pittsburgh addressed this challenge head-on at the R/Medicine 2025 conference. His innovative solution, the {redquack} package, is designed to optimize data workflows between REDCap and DuckDB, providing a memory-efficient alternative for processing large datasets.</p>
<section id="the-challenge-of-handling-large-datasets-in-redcap" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge-of-handling-large-datasets-in-redcap">The Challenge of Handling Large Datasets in REDCap</h2>
<p>At the School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, data scientists manage a REDCap database containing clinical data from over 200 outpatient treatment centers. This database is extensive, with nearly 3 million rows across 400 columns. Such large datasets pose a significant challenge when using traditional methods like the {REDCapR} package, which attempts to load all data into memory, often resulting in failures due to hardware limitations.</p>
<p>REDCap stores its data using a MySQL backend, which is typically managed by an institution’s IT department. Direct interfacing with this database is not recommended, pushing researchers to rely on APIs and packages to access the data. However, as datasets grow, these methods become inefficient and sometimes infeasible.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-redquack-package-a-solution-for-seamless-data-extraction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-redquack-package-a-solution-for-seamless-data-extraction">The {redquack} Package: A Solution for Seamless Data Extraction</h2>
<p>The {redquack} package emerged as a solution to these memory constraints by leveraging the power of DuckDB, a fast and portable SQL database management system. DuckDB’s columnar storage format makes it particularly suited for large-scale data processing, allowing data to be stored outside of R’s memory.</p>
<p>The package introduces a novel batch processing approach to data extraction. By breaking down data into manageable chunks, researchers can efficiently process portions of the dataset without ever exceeding memory limits. This method involves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Batch Processing</strong>: Data is extracted in configurable batches of record IDs, minimizing memory usage.</li>
<li><strong>Column Optimization</strong>: The package automatically optimizes column types across batches, enhancing query performance.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Logging</strong>: Users can track extraction progress through comprehensive logs, aiding in debugging and process monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Tidyverse</strong>: The resulting DuckDB connection can be seamlessly integrated with tidyverse workflows, allowing analysts to use familiar dplyr syntax for data manipulation.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="practical-implementation-and-benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-implementation-and-benefits">Practical Implementation and Benefits</h2>
<p>Using {redquack} is straightforward. Researchers need to provide their REDCap API credentials and configuration preferences to the <code>redcap_to_duckdb()</code> function. This function handles the extraction process, and the resulting DuckDB connection can be immediately utilized for data analysis.</p>
<p>The package includes several quality-of-life features, such as sound notifications (a “quack” on success) for long-running operations. This user-friendly approach empowers researchers to work with datasets that exceed memory constraints without compromising their existing workflows.</p>

<h1>Empowering Chronic Kidney Disease Research with the <code>kidney.epi</code> R Package: An Insight from R/Medicine 2025</h1>
<p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an escalating global health issue, affecting approximately 700 million individuals worldwide and leading to 3.2 million deaths annually. Despite its prevalence, CKD is often overlooked in health prevention programs and clinical trials, resulting in a significant awareness gap. Alarmingly, only 10-20% of those with CKD know they have the condition. Early detection and management are crucial to mitigate the progression to end-stage renal disease and prevent further complications.</p>
<section id="the-growing-ckd-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-growing-ckd-challenge">The Growing CKD Challenge</h2>
<p>The prevalence of CKD has surged nearly twofold over the past three decades, now affecting nearly 10% of the global population. CKD is more common than cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions. Age-standardized rates for CKD have increased, unlike many other non-communicable diseases where rates have declined. This trend suggests a future increase in CKD cases. High-risk groups, such as individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis, show CKD prevalence rates ranging from 20% to 60%. Moreover, about 40% of those aged 65 and older live with CKD, underscoring its significance in geriatric care.</p>
<p>CKD’s impact extends to pharmacotherapy, as kidneys play a pivotal role in drug elimination. Reduced kidney function necessitates dosage adjustments or contraindications for certain medications. Despite CKD’s high prevalence, patients with the condition are often excluded from clinical trials. A staggering 80% of cardiovascular medication trials exclude CKD patients, including 40% that exclude early-stage CKD patients.</p>

<h1>Automating Pretest Probability Calculations for Coronary Artery Disease with the <code>pretestcad</code> R Package</h1>
<p>In the ever-evolving field of cardiology, clinicians face the constant challenge of keeping up with the latest risk assessment models for coronary artery disease (CAD). Traditionally, tools like HeartScore have been used to calculate a patient’s risk of cardiovascular events. However, these tools are limited by their one-patient-at-a-time approach. Enter the realm of R packages—powerful tools that can automate and streamline these calculations for multiple patients simultaneously. Among them, the <code>pretestcad</code> R package emerges as a novel solution, specifically designed to address the gap in pretest risk assessment for obstructive CAD.</p>
<section id="understanding-coronary-artery-disease-and-pretest-probability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-coronary-artery-disease-and-pretest-probability">Understanding Coronary Artery Disease and Pretest Probability</h2>
<p>Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits known as plaques. This can result in chest pain, shortness of breath, or even heart attacks. Diagnosing CAD often involves invasive tests like coronary angiography or less invasive options such as CT scans. The concept of pretest probability comes into play here, providing an estimated likelihood that a patient has CAD before any diagnostic tests are performed. This estimation helps clinicians decide which diagnostic path to pursue, especially when certain tests are expensive or invasive.</p>

<section id="the-evolution-of-pretest-probability-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-evolution-of-pretest-probability-models">The Evolution of Pretest Probability Models</h2>
<p>As our understanding of CAD has grown, so too have the models for estimating pretest probability. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines have evolved from simple models with three risk factors to more sophisticated ones that include family history, smoking, cholesterol levels, hypertension, and diabetes. This increased complexity makes manual calculations tedious and prone to error.</p>
<p>Jeremy, a research officer from the National Heart Center Singapore, recognized this challenge and sought to address it by developing the <code>pretestcad</code> R package. This package automates the calculation of pretest probability scores for CAD, drawing on a comprehensive collection of models from past to present. The package is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, accommodating missing data and providing clear error messages.</p>

<h1>A Community-Powered Future for Regulatory R: Introducing Our Fundraising Campaign</h1>
<p>As many of you may have seen, we’ve officially launched a fundraising campaign for the <strong>Regulatory R Repository</strong> — a critical initiative built to support the safe, efficient, and confident use of R packages in regulated environments.</p>
<p>The <strong>Regulatory R Repository</strong> will provide a robust, <em>validation-ready collection of package metadata</em> using the R Validation Hub’s open-source <code>{riskmetric}</code> framework. Our goal is simple yet powerful: enable organizations to use R in their regulatory submissions.</p>
<section id="why-a-fundraising" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-a-fundraising">Why a fundraising?</h3>
<p>Until now, the project has been built entirely on volunteer contributions. This has helped us build momentum — but to <strong>scale delivery and ensure consistency</strong>, we need dedicated funding. Importantly, this project is <strong>company-agnostic</strong> by design. It lives under the umbrella of the <strong>R Consortium</strong>, not any single corporation like Roche or others, to ensure transparency, neutrality, and broad utility.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-it-just-for-pharma">Is it just for Pharma?</h3>
<p>While the pharmaceutical industry has been a key driver of this effort, our scope extends far beyond pharma. This repository will benefit <strong>any organization that must meet regulatory standards while using R</strong>. This includes universities, NGOs, and regulated industries such as <strong>agriculture, finance, insurance, and biotech</strong>. Wherever R is used in regulated or quality-sensitive contexts, the repository can provide assurance and clarity.</p>

<section id="what-will-we-deliver" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-will-we-deliver">What Will We Deliver?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tools for periodic assessment</strong> of public R packages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Template projects for in-house deployments</strong>, for organizations managing private packages</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>supplementary repository of metadata</strong> that supports the risk-assessment and governance of R environments in regulated settings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We’re deeply grateful to everyone who has contributed so far — your work has laid the foundation for what’s next.</p>

<section id="why-open-source" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-open-source">Why Open Source?</h3>
<p>You might wonder: <em>“If some industries have the resources to build software, why do open-source projects still rely on funding and volunteer contributions?”</em></p>
<p>Open Source thrives on collaboration rooted in <strong>transparency and trust</strong>. The solutions created in this space aren’t owned by any one company—they belong to the <strong>global community</strong>. That’s what makes them so powerful.</p>
<p>Across all industries, there are countless <strong>smaller companies, research institutes, non-profits, and independent teams</strong> with brilliant ideas but limited budgets. Without access to costly, proprietary tools, their growth and potential impact are often restricted. Open Source breaks down these barriers—enabling them to move faster, innovate, and build on <strong>trusted, freely available technologies</strong>.</p>
<p>While large enterprises do support Open Source—by funding organizations like the <strong>R Consortium</strong>, sponsoring events, or encouraging their employees to contribute—these efforts are often <strong>indirect</strong>. Open Source may not be owned, but it still needs to be built, maintained, and evolved. And that takes real resources.</p>
<p>That’s where <strong>non-profit organizations and community fundraising</strong> play a vital role. They help fuel projects that are developed in parallel by volunteers around the world. Open Source isn’t free to create—it’s just <strong>freely shared</strong>. Ongoing support from both the community and companies that benefit from it is essential to keep it growing.</p>

<p>Fundraising initiatives help direct resources to high-impact projects—<strong>accelerating innovation, expanding access, and ensuring that open collaboration remains a driving force for progress</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s build this resource together — for the benefit of the entire R community and every organization that relies on it to meet regulatory standards. 👉 <a href="https://pharmar.org/repository">https://pharmar.org/repository</a></p>
