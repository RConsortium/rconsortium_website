<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vboned/">Vicent Boned</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-eixarch/">Marc Eixarch</a>, organizers of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-finland/">R User Group Finland</a>, spoke with the R Consortium about how they revived the local R community by focusing on fun, practical applications of R. Drawing on their experience from Barcelona‚Äôs tech scene, they took over an inactive R group and began hosting engaging meetups focused on real-world applications of R. From building custom Spotify Wrapped-style reports to analyzing Helsinki‚Äôs real estate market, they‚Äôve created a meetup environment where data enthusiasts can explore R through real-world use cases that go beyond the workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> I‚Äôm a data analyst. I first learned R in university and used it for 10 to 12 years. We used to live in Barcelona, a large city with a very active tech community. We were involved with the R user group and another popular meetup called Data Beers. It‚Äôs still running, but we‚Äôve attended many of those events and enjoyed them.</p>
<p>When we moved to Finland, I began searching for similar community activities, but I couldn‚Äôt find many. I found a meetup group, but it was inactive, so I reached out to the organizer. He told me he had moved out of Helsinki and was happy to pass on the group‚Äôs organization to someone new. That‚Äôs how we took over the R user group in Finland. We‚Äôre not Finnish, but now we‚Äôre working to organize events here and stay connected with other data analysts.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-your-level-of-experience-with-the-r-language">What‚Äôs your level of experience with the R language?</h2>
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> I first encountered R in a university stats course, but I started working with it seriously once I became a data analyst. I‚Äôve been in this role for approximately six or seven years, with a primary focus on data analysis. I work extensively with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot</a> for data visualization, preparation, and gathering data from various sources, such as APIs and databases. That‚Äôs my main strength in R.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I take on small projects to explore more technical areas, such as package development, but in those areas, I‚Äôm more of a casual user than an expert. So, that‚Äôs a good summary of my experience level.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/spotify-stats-and-real-estate-insights-r-user-group-finland-builds-practical-projects/MarcExirach.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> I‚Äôve used R throughout my career, mainly for data analysis and visualization. While I‚Äôve explored other packages through side projects, my current work primarily revolves around tidyverse, ggplot, and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> for tables and reporting. At my company, we also utilize some Posit tools, such as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>, and occasionally Shiny for prototyping.</p>
<p>I used Shiny years ago in my second job when it was a new package. I didn‚Äôt work with it for many years after that, so it‚Äôs been exciting to see how much it has evolved. I‚Äôve also attended several RStudio conferences, and it has been great to follow the development of the Tidyverse over time.</p>

<p><strong>Vicent:</strong> At work, I use R for almost everything. I work for a gaming company, so my job involves analyzing user behavior and understanding how they interact with the app. This involves a significant amount of data exploration and visualization, as we have a wealth of data on nearly every action users take in the game. I often present my findings to non-technical team members, so I use R to create reports and presentations with Quarto, which I then share with the team. Your day-to-day work looks quite similar!</p>
<p>Recently‚Äîor, to be more precise, last year‚ÄîI worked on a side project while searching for an apartment to buy in Helsinki. I used R to explore the real estate market, gathering data over a few months to track trends. I built a small tool to filter listings based on different criteria, which was helpful for my search.</p>
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> I‚Äôve worked on a few small side projects, usually based on things I‚Äôm curious about or enjoy. I‚Äôm really into music, and one time, I discovered an API that lets you access Spotify data using R. With it, you can pull public data from Spotify and even create your own ‚ÄúSpotify Wrapped‚Äù experience. I liked this use case so much that I turned it into a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-finland/events/291613918/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">workshop</a> for one of our events. I prepared a tutorial and shared the code in advance, and then about 10‚Äì15 of us walked through it together. Everyone can input their username to customize the script, which displays their top artists, playlist vibe, or other insights based on their Spotify data.</p>
<p>We have posted the project on GitHub, making it available for anyone to review. It was especially noteworthy because one attendee, Antti, took the project a step further by expanding it into a web application. He added functionality that allows you to type in something like ‚Äúsad, melancholic metal,‚Äù which suggests a fitting band or song. He got creative; we even got permission to share the app link. It was one of my favorite projects to see grow beyond the workshop! <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spotifyr/index.html">{spotifyr} on CRAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr">on GitHub</a></p>

  <title>How R Powers Cancer Research and Community Teaching in Austria</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/how-r-powers-cancer-research-and-community-teaching-in-austria/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekaterina-akimova-7727801a6/">Ekaterina Akimova-H√∂pner</a>, founder of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-salzburg/">R-Ladies Salzburg</a> chapter, recently spoke with the R Consortium about using R to support cutting-edge cancer research and building a local R community in Austria. Ekaterina shared how she uses R for data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualizing high-dimensional genomic datasets. She discussed the launch of R-Ladies Salzburg in 2024, the importance of hands-on workshops for early-career researchers, and how scientific collaboration continues to shape her approach to community building. She also highlighted her talk last year at the useR! Conference 2024, where she presented tools for reproducible research in biomedical science.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p>I come from a background in medical biology, with a strong focus on cancer research. I completed my PhD at the University of Salzburg, where I investigated tumor genetics and immune evasion mechanisms, particularly in leukemia, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Initially, my work was purely wet lab-based, but it quickly evolved into a combination of both experimental and computational biology. This dual focus naturally led me to the R programming environment, which has become an essential part of my daily work.</p>
<p>During my doctoral studies, I started using R for statistical analysis and data visualization. As my projects became more complex and my research questions grew more intricate, I began building pipelines and analysis workflows in R, utilizing packages from Bioconductor, Tidyverse, and various other resources.</p>
<p>My passion for the language and the broader community grew as I discovered the power and accessibility of the R environment. This enthusiasm ultimately led me to establish the R-Ladies Salzburg chapter last year, in 2024, as there were no local user groups in the area.</p>
<p>At that time, it felt right to organize a group explicitly focused on supporting gender minorities in tech and science. I noticed a significant gap in the community that I was eager to fill. Establishing this chapter provided me with the invaluable opportunity to create an inclusive space for women in the science and data science communities in Salzburg.</p>
<p>In our first year, 2024, I planned and organized four meetups, ranging from beginner R workshops to networking events. During this time, I connected with members and organizers from all over the world, which was an enriching experience. I was fortunate to be involved in organizing last year‚Äôs useR! conference, which took place in Salzburg. One of my most rewarding moments was presenting my R package, which is in development for analyzing amplicon sequence data. I was honored to receive the Best Poster award, and the positive feedback I received strengthened my desire to give back to the community and support others on their R journey.</p>

<p>Being part of the R-Ladies global community has broadened my horizons, and I have improved my public speaking, mentorship, and event organization skills.</p>

<p>R is actively used in various fields, particularly in academia and banking. While there are several user groups in Austria, they are mainly concentrated in the eastern part of the country, with Salzburg having a smaller presence. For instance, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/viennar/">Vienna R User Group</a>, along with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-vienna/">R-Ladies Vienna</a>, represents a large community with which I‚Äôve had the pleasure of connecting. However, organizing in-person events in the western region, particularly in Salzburg, is still a challenge. I see an opportunity to facilitate in-person meetings for those living in this area, helping to grow the local community.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-challenges-have-you-faced-in-organizing-the-group">What challenges have you faced in organizing the group?</h2>
<p>The first challenge we faced was working with the Meetup platform, which is the tool of choice for R user group meetups. It isn‚Äôt very well established, so not many people are familiar with it. In addition to Meetup, we also use Slack and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/r-ladies-salzburg/">LinkedIn</a> for communication. While Meetup does send notifications to those who sign up, it is challenging to reach a new audience through it. Therefore, enhancing our presence on LinkedIn will help ensure that more people are aware of our events.</p>

Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to the industry you work in?</h2>
<p>Let me share my project on detecting complex rearrangements in next-generation sequencing data. The project aims to create a tool for detecting and characterizing complex genomic rearrangements, specifically templated sequence insertions, duplications, and inversions, using next-generation sequencing data. Previous studies have demonstrated that aberrant DNA double-strand break repair is a common feature in various types of cancer. In our earlier research, we discovered that these breaks can lead to genomic alterations that are not captured by standard variant-calling tools currently in use. For instance, we found evidence that high intracellular dNTP levels, observed in SAMHD1-deficient cells, promote increased templated sequence insertions.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/how-r-powers-cancer-research-and-community-teaching-in-austria/NGSDataProject.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>To quantify and characterize these events, we needed a pipeline capable of handling these datasets and performing filtering, characterization, and visualization. I chose to use R for this task because I felt more confident programming in R at the time. I developed an R-based pipeline utilizing packages from Bioconductor, including <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html">IRanges</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html">GenomicRanges</a>, along with base R and the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>The package takes over after the initial preprocessing steps of sequencing data, which include trimming, stitching, and BLAST alignment. It processes data downstream to detect sequence aberrations directly from FASTQ sequences or BLAST results, depending on what the research requires. One of the key features of our pipeline is the self-comparison metrics algorithm, which identifies internal duplications within the sequence reads.</p>
<p>Currently, the project isn‚Äôt widely available on the market, but it is in progress. Parts of it have been published, and we are using the packages internally at the institute. The goal is to submit it to <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> once it is fully completed, and we are nearing that finish line.</p>
<p>This project primarily aimed to answer our main research question, and we successfully achieved this goal. We applied the same pipeline to other projects to address similar questions, focusing on how to significantly reduce the frequency of duplications while suggesting a novel role of a specific protein in maintaining genomic stability. The clinical relevance of these findings will be determined through future studies.</p>
<p>This project has significantly expanded my understanding of genomic structures and the approach to addressing these questions through programming. It has enabled me to visualize and filter out genomic aberrations, thereby clarifying biologically relevant findings.</p>

<p>My main current project marks my first step into self-employment, leveraging my expertise in academic research, biomedicine, and data science, with a focus on consulting and science education. A significant aspect of this project involves teaching data literacy and programming, particularly using R, to complete beginners, including those from non-technical backgrounds such as the humanities, social sciences, and creative disciplines. I‚Äôm currently developing a course for absolute beginners, designed to demystify data tools and help learners build confidence through hands-on, approachable content.</p>
<p>What makes this project meaningful to me is that I‚Äôm not just teaching code, I‚Äôm guiding people through the anxiety of starting something new, helping them see that they don‚Äôt have to be math geniuses or seasoned programmers to understand data. I aim to help people feel empowered, not intimidated, by the world of data.</p>
<p>To complement this technical side, I‚Äôm also working on a course called ‚ÄúMindful Doctorate,‚Äù which addresses the emotional challenges of doing a PhD. It‚Äôs based on my own academic experiences and the conversations I‚Äôve had with peers. Many doctoral candidates struggle silently with imposter syndrome or isolation. This course will offer practical strategies for navigating that journey with greater mental clarity.</p>
<p>The common thread is to bridge technical knowledge with human communication and resilience. Learning should not only make you smarter, but also stronger and more self-aware.</p>
<p>Long-term, this will evolve into a hybrid offering, comprising online courses, live workshops, community-based projects, and one-on-one mentoring or consulting in research workflows. I‚Äôm particularly interested in collaborating with clients or institutions that aim to integrate data skills into interdisciplinary settings.</p>
<p>To summarize, my ongoing project primarily focuses on helping people find ways to realize their ideas or research objectives and to understand their data. So, whether you are analyzing a complex dataset, managing a project in the wet lab, or searching for a novel solution, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, and I‚Äôd be happy to chat.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The R Consortium recently spoke with Mauricio ‚ÄúPach√°‚Äù Vargas Sep√∫lveda, a PhD student in Economics at the University of Surrey and the developer behind <strong>cpp11armadillo</strong>, a package funded through the R Consortium‚Äôs ISC grant program. cpp11armadillo connects R with the Armadillo C++ linear algebra library through the modern cpp11 interface, providing developers with safer, more flexible tools for computationally intensive work.</p>
<p>The R Consortium has provided grants to Pach√° two different times, including <a href="https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2024-group-2.html#cpp11armadillo-an-armadillo-interface-c">most recently in late 2024</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-loves-math-cpp11armadillo-connects-r-with-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-library-prioritizes-prioritize-safety-over-speed/pacha.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<p>In this interview, conducted by email, Pach√° discussed the current state of the project, the balance between safety and performance, and the kinds of features that make cpp11armadillo especially useful compared to other approaches. He also shared insights on future development priorities and reflected on his experience working with the R Consortium grant process.</p>
<p>The conversation highlights both the technical progress of cpp11armadillo and the value of community support in driving open-source innovation within the R ecosystem.</p>
<section id="what-is-the-current-development-status-of-cpp11armadillo-and-is-the-speed-optimized-version-you-mentioned-in-the-proposal-already-available-for-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-current-development-status-of-cpp11armadillo-and-is-the-speed-optimized-version-you-mentioned-in-the-proposal-already-available-for-testing">What is the current development status of cpp11armadillo, and is the speed-optimized version you mentioned in the proposal already available for testing?</h3>
<p><em>cpp11armadillo</em> has reached a stable stage according to the Tidyverse‚Äôs lifecycle. This means I am happy with the interface, I do not see major issues, and it reached a point where I was happy to share it with others. The current CRAN version is 0.5.4 and is available here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11armadillo">https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpp11armadillo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-loves-math-cpp11armadillo-connects-r-with-armadillo-cpp-linear-algebra-library-prioritizes-prioritize-safety-over-speed/cpp11armadillo_logo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>At the present time I have a testing branch on my local git tree, it requires further work (lots of work, actually), and it aims at obtaining a (much) better speed to convert from R to Armadillo data types and vice versa. <em>cpp11armadillo</em> followed this premise from Don Knuth: ‚Äúpremature optimization is the root of all evil.‚Äù I tried to make sure to write a comprehensive list of unit tests and prioritize safety over speed (e.g., if we convert R‚Äôs integers to C++ unsigned integers we need to be careful about negative values and check bounds to avoid undefined behaviours).</p>

<p>We currently support most Armadillo functions, as we covered with examples in the <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/">official documentation</a>. Some functions require dedicated wrappers for them, as it is the case of Armadillo‚Äôs <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/articles/statistics-and-clustering.html?q=pca#princomp">Principal Component Analysis</a>. Because R already provides a PCA function, we focused on supporting sparse matrices and expanding on different functions such as the <a href="https://pacha.dev/cpp11armadillo/articles/signal-and-image-processing.html#fft-ifft-2">Fast Fourier Transform</a></p>

<p>Both use the same underlying library. The main difference is that cpp11armadillo is slightly faster with the default configuration, which is not as important because we can compile against OpenBLAS or other optimised linear algebra libraries. The main advantage of cpp11armadillo over RcppArmadillo is that we offer a vendoring feature, which allows the user to copy all of cpp11armadillo codebase into an R package, eliminating the dependency requirement, allowing to use a snapshotted version of the code for replication purposes, and it facilitates running code routines in restricted environments (such as servers or clusters with restricted internet access).</p>

<p>Future versions plan to offer a much better copy of complex numbers that right now we import back into C++ using lists because of a limitation in the underlying cpp11 package codebase. We already sent a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/427">few Pull Requests to add complex numbers support in cpp11</a>, plus a <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/428">few fixed bugs affecting attributes for matrices</a>, adding the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/437">code to export C++ ordered and unordered maps to R lists</a>, and a few other features and bug fixes.</p>

<p>It has been a great experience. My first proposal was accepted, which allowed me to create a first stable version, and then the second proposal was rejected over totally valid concerns about coordination between cpp11 (maintained by Posit, formerly RStudio) and cpp11armadillo development. For a third proposal I obtained funding again after reading the feedback carefully and focusing exclusively on the internal package development instead of uncertain upstream changes.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliasilge/">Julia Silge</a>, co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/">Salt Lake City R User Group</a>, recently talked to the R Consortium about sustaining an active R community in a region without a central tech hub. Julia shared how she discovered R and became deeply engaged with its open-source ecosystem. She discussed the group‚Äôs dual-format meetups, which include remote talks streamed via YouTube and quarterly in-person gatherings, as well as efforts to make the community inclusive for both local professionals and a wider audience. She also highlighted a recent session on advanced Git practices and an upcoming talk on sparse data structures in the tidymodels framework.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p>My academic background is in physics and astronomy. About ten years ago, I transitioned from a more academic career into data science, and that‚Äôs when I first discovered R. I wasn‚Äôt very familiar with it; I had only heard about it in passing. The aspects of R that immediately appealed to me were its functional approach to data analysis and its programming style, which has a Lispy flavor.</p>
<p>The R community played a significant role in my identifying it as a tool that was a good fit for me. This included engaging with the open-source community and contributing to open-source projects early in my R journey. Additionally, I became connected with groups such as R-Ladies, although there isn‚Äôt an R-Ladies chapter in my local city. I started attending a local RUG meetup around ten years ago in my town.</p>
<p>My city is a smaller US city‚Äîit‚Äôs not on the coasts and doesn‚Äôt have a large tech scene like the Bay Area. Finding people here to connect with and discuss our work was incredibly valuable for me.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-salt-lake-city">Can you share what the R community is like in Salt Lake City?</h2>
<p>Our city is significantly influenced by the presence of a large university, which serves as a significant hub for research, especially in the life sciences. A substantial number of people associated with the university contribute to the local community. Additionally, outside of the university, professionals work at healthcare systems, including the VA hospital, which serve the entire region.</p>
<p>Several life science startups in the area focus on drug discovery and other health science initiatives. Many individuals involved in these startups have university backgrounds, although they are no longer directly affiliated with their respective institutions. The use of R programming is quite prevalent in these environments.</p>
<p>Overall, our community is shaped not only by those engaged in pure research but also by entrepreneurs and professionals who apply their knowledge, especially in the field of health sciences, creating a dynamic intersection between academia and industry.</p>

<section id="do-you-host-online-or-in-person-meetups" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-host-online-or-in-person-meetups">Do you host online or in-person meetups?</h2>
<p>We try to have a meeting most months, although we slow down a bit during the summer. There are two types of meetings we hold. The first type features a speaker who gives a talk. Since the pandemic began, we have been hosting these talks remotely via Zoom, rather than in person. We‚Äôve found that this format works very well, allowing us to connect with people from all over, not just those in the Salt Lake area.</p>
<p>These meetings are scheduled during lunchtime in our local time zone, allowing those of us in the area to take a break from work and join in to hear and learn about various topics. For our attendees in European time zones, the talks take place in the evening, which has worked out nicely.</p>
<p>The second type of meeting we have is an in-person gathering that occurs about once a quarter. There isn‚Äôt a speaker for these events; instead, we focus on networking and casual conversations about what everyone is working on. These in-person meetings are only for residents of our city.</p>
<p>Overall, this balance is working well for us. The online talks, which are also streamed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@slcrug/streams">YouTube</a>, make it easy for people to watch later if they‚Äôre interested. You can find all our recent discussions under the ‚ÄúLive‚Äù section on our channel. Meanwhile, the in-person meetings allow for valuable face-to-face interactions among local attendees.</p>

<section id="please-tell-us-about-the-organizing-team." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-tell-us-about-the-organizing-team.">Please tell us about the organizing team.</h2>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-redd-202b5736/">Andrew Redd</a> and I are the only ones involved in organizing. We‚Äôve had a few other people who have joined at various times but ultimately stepped away. Andrew was part of the team before I joined, back when he was at the university. Initially, our meetings took place on campus, but that posed challenges for those who didn‚Äôt work at the university. It was difficult to navigate, especially for newcomers who weren‚Äôt familiar with where to go and where to park.</p>
<p>About seven or eight years ago, we decided to switch to using Meetup, allowing us to meet in different locations around the city that are more accessible for those who work downtown or aren‚Äôt on campus all day. I started helping with organizing the events around the same time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve done reasonably well in terms of consistency, although we don‚Äôt have events every single month. We typically aim for most months, although we often take December and January off and slow down a bit in the summer. We strive to host either a talk or a networking event during those months, providing an opportunity for us to get together and connect.</p>
</section>
<section id="please-tell-us-about-a-recent-or-upcoming-event-from-your-group." class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-tell-us-about-a-recent-or-upcoming-event-from-your-group.">Please tell us about a recent or upcoming event from your group.</h2>
<p>We have two upcoming meetings scheduled! For our discussion today, I‚Äôll highlight one event that took place in the past, so people can watch the video, and one that is coming up for anyone who wants to join us.</p>
<p>Recently, we held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEAEvcnA9Hs">meetup in May</a>, with our primary focus on improving <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/events/304955799/">Git practices</a>. We often find ourselves familiar only with the basic commands in Git‚Äîsuch as committing, pushing, and pulling‚Äîbut there‚Äôs much more we can learn. The talk centered on enhancing our Git skills and strategies for troubleshooting difficult situations, which is something many of us struggle with.</p>
<p>The session was well-attended, and participants appreciated the practical skills shared during the event. It was a great example of how our group aims to provide applied knowledge that is genuinely useful.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we have another exciting talk scheduled for the end of July. This presentation will delve into how we think about our data, specifically concerning data structures. We‚Äôll explore the concept of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/slc-rug/events/307528267/">sparse data structures</a>, which are particularly common in machine learning contexts.</p>
<p>For instance, with text data, certain words are used frequently while many others appear only a few times. This creates sparse data structures, where the majority of elements in a matrix are zero. Often, we don‚Äôt consider how our data is represented, but understanding this is crucial.</p>
<p>This upcoming talk will explain how sparse data structures are integrated into the tidymodels framework, emphasizing the efficiency gains that can be achieved. By using sparse data structures, we can handle larger models that might otherwise be impossible to train on a standard computer due to memory constraints. I‚Äôm looking forward to this informative session!</p>

(Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?</h2>
<p>A good approach for us is to block out time for planning. Instead of trying to plan every single month, we can dedicate time to creating a plan that covers the next four or five months. We always strive to highlight local speakers from the Salt Lake area, but not all of our speakers are local. So, we‚Äôll consider who from our community has done something interesting recently.</p>
<p>Additionally, we keep an eye out for interesting blog posts that inspire potential speakers. Our group is very friendly and open, providing an excellent opportunity for members to present initial versions of talks they‚Äôre working on. If someone has a critical conference approaching, we often invite them to give a practice version of their presentation here before they present at a larger event. This setup is beneficial for both our group and the speaker.</p>
<p>We also stream our presentations on YouTube, making it easy for speakers to have a video link of their talk. If someone has a blog post they‚Äôve created, we can help them by providing a video version of their work to share with their audience.</p>
<p>To sum up, some helpful techniques we use include planning for four to five months at a time, sending out emails to potential speakers, and considering topics based on our work or interesting discussions we‚Äôve had. Lastly, we aim to find individuals who could benefit from practice opportunities or who want to share their work. These are some of the techniques we employ.</p>

<p>Pictures from the R track during the Abraji congress. Jade Mar√©, co-organizer at R-Ladies S√£o Paulo and a Carpentries certified instructor (woman in blue). Rafael Pereira, head of Data at Ipea, the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, a federal government institution (man in glasses). He‚Äôs the creator of packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geobr/vignettes/intro_to_geobr.html">geobr</a>, <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/censobr/index.html">censobr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geocodebr/index.html">geocodebr</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flightsbr/vignettes/intro_flightsbr.html">flightsbr</a> and many more, and Carol Moreno, Abraji Director (woman in peacock sweater).</p>
<p>From Carol:</p>
<p>‚ÄúA quick summary: we have over 30 people taking place in our sessions and had great feedback. And I was really happy to see that people who took the introductory sessions last year (the ones that take place in the morning) came back this year in the afternoon to catch Rafael‚Äôs session. One of them is an investigative journalist who said that, after learning R last year, he took some more courses online and began practicing, and is now using R to produce news stories and interested in learning more and more!‚Äù</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST</p>
<p>The <a href="https://abraji.org.br/english">Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji)</a>‚Äôs annual international congress will take place on July 10th-13th in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. And the final day is dedicated to data. Traditionally called ‚ÄúDomingo de Dados‚Äù (Data Sunday), it‚Äôs a full day for journalist professionals and students from all over the country to take part in seven simultaneous labs with workshops and panels and learn new skills to apply data science in their investigations and coverage.</p>
<p>One of the labs will be entirely dedicated to teaching R. Participants will spend the morning in an introductory session to R led by R-Ladies S√£o Paulo volunteer instructors and TAs, especially designed for statistical analysis considering the specifics of journalism and using Brazilian electoral data.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/teaching-r-to-investigative-journalists-in-brazil/data-sunday-2024.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the afternoon, they will learn how to use the R packages <code>censobr</code> and <code>geobr</code>, two o f the most used ones for Brazilian census and geospatial data. The workshop will be given by Rafael Pereira, Chief of Data for Ipea, the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research, who created both packages. They will also get to practice the new skills and interview official government databases to try and find news stories, with the help of the instructors.</p>
<p>Because of its proximity to statistical analysis, R is one of the languages chosen by journalists on their first steps in acquiring data science skills to take their investigative work to a higher level. The investment in their training brings invaluable results in the form of news articles that expose detrimental public policies, fraud and other risks to our democracy, helping hold governments accountable and reduce social and economic inequality.</p>

<section id="about-deq" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-deq">About DEQ</h3>
<p>The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is responsible for administering laws and regulations associated with air quality, water quality and supply, renewable energy, and land protection in the Commonwealth of Virginia. These responsibilities generate tremendous quantities of data from monitoring environmental quality, managing permitting processes across environmental media, responding to pollution events, and more. The data collected by DEQ requires management and analysis to gain insight, inform decision making, and meet legal and public obligations.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-emphasis-on-analytics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-emphasis-on-analytics">An Emphasis on Analytics</h3>
<section id="analytics-community" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analytics-community"><em>Analytics Community</em></h4>
<p>Throughout the last 10 years, DEQ staff have worked to develop an analytics community to advocate for access to preferred tools, create content governance, facilitate training, share best practices, and collaborate across analytics platforms. DEQ staff have created technology-specific teams to help bridge the gap between the agency‚Äôs IT group, the Office of Information Services (OIS), and analytical tool users. Building these connections between OIS and staff shortens enterprise tool incident response times, ensures buy-in when decisions are made that impact users, amplifies program-specific technology/analytical needs, and promotes collaboration among colleagues. Formalizing content management and software maintenance processes through these teams helps address security concerns and promote trust between management, OIS, and end users. This, in turn, has created a greater emphasis on analytics at DEQ, which contributes to a willingness to invest in resources to support our enterprise analytical tools.</p>
<p>The analytics environments that OIS manages include Posit, Esri‚Äôs ArcGIS, and Tableau. Here, we will focus on the integration of our Posit and ArcGIS environments to modernize data collection methods for water quality monitoring. We‚Äôll begin with a review of these environments and how they have structurally changed as a function of this emphasis on analytics. Then, we‚Äôll present work describing how these environments were leveraged to modernize mobile data collection at DEQ.</p>
</section>
<section id="posit" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="posit"><em>Posit</em></h4>
<p>DEQ staff have been using R since the early 2000‚Äôs, gradually growing the userbase with new hires and internal training. The increasing need for shared content and an internal hosting environment culminated with a single instance of Posit Connect being released in 2019. However, this environment relied on program staff for administration. With the growth in desktop R usage and Posit Connect content, program staff created a team of R users to create governance and processes to support the long-term maintenance of the server and hosted content. As R content grew, OIS recognized the need for dedicated support for the Posit Connect environment.</p>
<p>In 2024, OIS filled a new position dedicated to analytics administration and began work on upgrading the Posit environment. This upgrade involved moving to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, upgrading enterprise versions of R, expanding the environment to include a Test and Production instance of Posit Connect, and investing in Posit Package Manager. Today, DEQ‚Äôs R users leverage desktop RStudio to support data management and analysis workflows. DEQ uses Posit Package Manager to ensure that staff are working off of the same date-versioned CRAN snapshot, which simplifies collaboration. GitLab is used for version control. Shiny applications, markdown and quarto documents, as well as pinned datasets are developed in RStudio locally, and deployed to Posit Connect Test, and then our Production instance after the completion of relevant requirements.</p>
</section>
<section id="esri" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="esri"><em>Esri</em></h4>
<p>As of Winter 2023, DEQ implemented a fully federated ArcGIS Enterprise deployment, which encompasses both Test and Production environments. This deployment includes ArcGIS Server, Portal for ArcGIS, ArcGIS Data Store, ArcGIS Survey123, and ArcGIS Web Adaptor. The environments are hosted across two virtual machines with corresponding Enterprise Geodatabases serving as the primary repository for nearly all agency GIS data.</p>
<p>Data from these central GIS enterprise databases are routinely transferred to various File Geodatabases or processed through nightly Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts. These scripts facilitate public access to GIS data and enable updates to DEQ‚Äôs Comprehensive Environmental Data System (CEDS), which includes both a front-end user interface and an underlying database.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modernizing-mobile-data-collection-at-deq">Modernizing Mobile Data Collection at DEQ</h3>
<section id="history-of-mobile-data-collection" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history-of-mobile-data-collection"><em>History of Mobile Data Collection</em></h4>
<p>The primary method of data collection at DEQ relies on printing a waterproof data sheet generated from CEDS and filling it out with a black ink pen. When in the field, the data is read from the screen of a multiparameter sonde system and handwritten onto the field sheet. As an example, DEQ‚Äôs lake protocols include producing a profile of water quality parameters at every meter, from the surface to the bottom of an impoundment. After returning to a workstation, a data collector types this data from a field sheet into the CEDS front end, which then moves the data into the CEDS database. This method requires a keen eye and clear focus to avoid making transpositional errors. Even with excellent data input skills, these standard operations take a significant amount of time to execute. This created an opportunity to try a new digital data collection method with the goal of improving not only the quality of data, but the speed at which it can be securely collected and stored.</p>

<section id="the-solution" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-solution"><em>The Solution</em></h4>
<section id="arcgis-survey123" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arcgis-survey123">ArcGIS Survey123</h5>
<p>To implement a mobile data collection solution, DEQ modified its ArcGIS Enterprise infrastructure to include a Survey123 website hosted on internal servers. Additionally, DEQ established a new branch-versioned database connection, enabling publication services from DEQ‚Äôs Enterprise Geodatabase for use in ArcGIS Survey123 Connect to build monitoring surveys.</p>
<p>The mobile data collection process begins with the preparation of ArcGIS Survey123 Connect forms in XLSX format, which are populated with the upcoming year‚Äôs monitoring plan. This plan, which is now generated in R, consolidates all monitoring sites into discrete monitoring runs, scheduled at regular intervals to meet program objectives. The monitoring team uses R to query DEQ‚Äôs internal database (CEDS) for this information, identifying specific monitoring runs (e.g.&nbsp;lake vs.&nbsp;biological monitoring), to populate surveys with accurate information. Geospatial data from DEQ‚Äôs internal GIS portal is then accessed via the R-ArcGIS Bridge (specifically the arcgisutils and arcgislayers packages), then joined to the CEDS data in R to provide additional station information. Once finalized, the monitoring team publishes the surveys to the internal GIS portal through ArcGIS Survey123 Connect and distributes them annually to field teams.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-collection" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection">Data Collection</h5>
<p>Monitoring teams collect field data using these customized surveys on field-ready devices. They often use the software‚Äôs offline capabilities, storing data locally until they have service to send completed surveys to the internal ArcGIS portal. The surveys include quality assurance (QA) checks that enforce numeric thresholds and minimum data requirements, ensuring accuracy and compliance with database rules. For lake surveys, where sample profiles of multiple parameters are collected at depth, teams can visualize the data in real-time to confirm accuracy. Once data is entered and equipment passes calibration post checks, the teams submit the data to the ArcGIS portal and prepare samples for shipment to a lab for further analysis.</p>

<section id="extract-transform-and-load" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extract-transform-and-load">Extract, Transform, and Load</h5>
<p>Each evening, after all monitoring activities are published to the internal ArcGIS portal, a custom Python script processes the newly collected data using the ArcPy library. The script retrieves only the samples entered that day, joining them with critical metadata from CEDS. The data is then pulled into R using the R-ArcGIS Bridge. These data then undergo a series of quality assurance (QA) checks in R to ensure they meet minimum requirements. Once the data passes all QA steps, the script appends the new information in the CEDS database for ultimate storage. This process streamlines data management, automating the extraction, transformation, and loading of water quality data from the field into CEDS, while maintaining data integrity, and minimizing human error.</p>

<p>This field data is used the next morning by the centralized laboratory to track samples staged for analysis at the lab. These data are also made accessible in CEDS by the ETL process described above, which enables our Posit environment to query this information. Monitoring teams and managers can visualize data using custom Posit Connect hosted shiny applications. These applications streamline data querying and management by providing a user-friendly database front end. Simplifying data querying and management through Posit Connect hosted shiny applications helps DEQ staff respond to internal and public data inquiries.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supporting-the-water-quality-assessment-process">Supporting the Water Quality Assessment Process</h5>
<p>Every two years, DEQ must assess all applicable data in order to report on the status of water quality throughout the Commonwealth per Clean Water Act mandates. The assessment data analytics team coalesces water quality data across multiple data sources using R, documenting all steps from data querying and cleaning through data analysis and summarization. DEQ utilizes a hybrid approach to automating the Water Quality Assessment process, leveraging desktop R to organize and suggest results for millions of data records, then scientists further investigate these results through a suite of customized Posit Connect-hosted shiny applications built to visualize raw data and analyzed results. These human-verified assessments are stored in an assessment-specific module of DEQ‚Äôs CEDS database that gets shared with EPA to complete reporting requirements.</p>

<section id="benefits-of-change" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits-of-change"><em>Benefits of Change</em></h4>
<p>During the initial stages of this data collection modernization project, which was isolated to a single DEQ region, staff digitally collected over 91,427 data points across 225 sites across 657 sampling events. This data had enhanced QA applied to them both in the ArcGIS Survey123 interface and via the integration with R and Python-based QA and Posit Connect hosted shiny applications. This direct connection between the data and DEQ‚Äôs database undoubtedly removed manual transcription errors and saved at least 127 hours of staff time spent solely on data re-entry. Growing this effort to encompass more regions and more sampling programs has the potential to massively increase time savings and improve data quality.</p>
<p>DEQ has taken steps throughout the past several years to empower and grow its analytics community and enterprise tools. These investments enable staff to better collaborate on projects across analytical platforms, creatively solving business problems and overcoming barriers that have previously seemed insurmountable. The adoption of these modern strategies allows greater efficiency and flexibility for both data collectors and end users. Ultimately these tools will allow for new growth as legacy processes can be reimagined in a digital landscape.</p>

<section id="leveraging-r-shiny-for-automated-decision-analytic-modeling-in-cost-effectiveness-analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Leveraging R Shiny for Automated Decision-Analytic Modeling in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h1>
<p>The landscape of health economic evaluation is increasingly influenced by computational tools, and R is playing a pivotal role in this transformation. Mahip Acharya, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, has showcased the power of R and R Shiny in automating decision-analytic modeling for cost-effectiveness analysis. This innovative approach provides a flexible and efficient method of evaluating economic outcomes, particularly in the healthcare sector.</p>
<section id="understanding-cost-effectiveness-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-cost-effectiveness-analysis">Understanding Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h2>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a form of economic evaluation that compares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of different courses of action. It is commonly used in healthcare to determine the value of interventions, such as medications or surgical procedures, by assessing how much benefit they provide relative to their cost. The benefits are typically measured in terms of life years gained or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).</p>
<p>In CEA, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is a crucial metric. It represents the additional cost per additional unit of benefit (e.g., per QALY). Decision-makers often compare the ICER to a willingness-to-pay threshold to determine if an intervention is cost-effective. For instance, in the United States, thresholds can range from $50,000 to $150,000 per QALY.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-role-of-markov-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-role-of-markov-models">The Role of Markov Models</h2>
<p>Markov models are frequently employed in CEA to simulate the progression of diseases over time. They are particularly useful for modeling chronic conditions where the disease state changes over a long period. In a Markov model, patients transition between different health states at specified probabilities, which can be influenced by interventions.</p>
<p>In his demonstration, Mahip Acharya utilized a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a treatment for hypertension. The model included various health states, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and death. Patients transition between these states based on predefined probabilities, and the model calculates the associated costs and QALYs.</p>
</section>
<section id="automating-the-process-with-r-shiny" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="automating-the-process-with-r-shiny">Automating the Process with R Shiny</h2>
<p>R Shiny offers an interactive platform for building web applications directly from R. Mahip leveraged Shiny to automate the process of decision-analytic modeling, making it accessible for users without extensive programming expertise. The application allows users to input various parameters, such as transition probabilities, costs, and health utilities, through a user-friendly interface.</p>
<section id="key-features-of-the-shiny-application" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-features-of-the-shiny-application">Key Features of the Shiny Application</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Model Structure Visualization</strong>: Users can upload a PDF depicting the Markov model structure. The application reads the state names directly from the file, eliminating the need for manual input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Input Flexibility</strong>: The app accepts multiple data inputs, including transition rates, hazard ratios, treatment costs, and health utilities. These inputs can be adjusted to explore different scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive Output</strong>: The application calculates and displays key outputs, such as total costs, total QALYs, and ICERs. Users can adjust the model parameters, such as the discount rate and model cycle length, to see how these changes affect the results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generalizability and Adaptability</strong>: While the current model focuses on hypertension, the framework can be adapted to other chronic conditions by modifying the disease states and transition probabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="challenges-and-future-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-and-future-work">Challenges and Future Work</h2>
<p>While the application serves as a robust proof of concept, Mahip acknowledges several areas for future improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expanding File Format Support</strong>: Currently, the model structure must be uploaded as a PDF. Adding support for other image formats like PNG or JPEG would enhance usability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incorporating Sensitivity Analyses</strong>: Implementing deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses would provide deeper insights into the model‚Äôs robustness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhancing User Inputs</strong>: Allowing users to specify different cycle lengths (e.g., annual or monthly) and starting cohorts would increase the model‚Äôs flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting Multiple Treatment Groups</strong>: The current version of the app supports only one treatment group. Expanding to multiple groups would accommodate more complex analyses.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The integration of R Shiny with decision-analytic modeling marks a significant advancement in the field of health economic evaluation. By automating processes and providing a user-friendly interface, Mahip Acharya‚Äôs approach empowers researchers and decision-makers to conduct comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses with greater efficiency and precision. As the application evolves, it promises to become an invaluable tool in the evaluation of healthcare interventions, ultimately contributing to more informed and cost-effective healthcare decisions.</p>
