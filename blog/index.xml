<section id="a-community-powered-future-for-regulatory-r-introducing-our-fundraising-campaign" class="level1">
<h1>A Community-Powered Future for Regulatory R: Introducing Our Fundraising Campaign</h1>
<p>As many of you may have seen, we‚Äôve officially launched a fundraising campaign for the <strong>Regulatory R Repository</strong> ‚Äî a critical initiative built to support the safe, efficient, and confident use of R packages in regulated environments.</p>
<p>The <strong>Regulatory R Repository</strong> will provide a robust, <em>validation-ready collection of package metadata</em> using the R Validation Hub‚Äôs open-source <code>{riskmetric}</code> framework. Our goal is simple yet powerful: enable organizations to use R in their regulatory submissions.</p>
<section id="why-a-fundraising" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-a-fundraising">Why a fundraising?</h3>
<p>Until now, the project has been built entirely on volunteer contributions. This has helped us build momentum ‚Äî but to <strong>scale delivery and ensure consistency</strong>, we need dedicated funding. Importantly, this project is <strong>company-agnostic</strong> by design. It lives under the umbrella of the <strong>R Consortium</strong>, not any single corporation like Roche or others, to ensure transparency, neutrality, and broad utility.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-it-just-for-pharma" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-it-just-for-pharma">Is it just for Pharma?</h3>
<p>While the pharmaceutical industry has been a key driver of this effort, our scope extends far beyond pharma. This repository will benefit <strong>any organization that must meet regulatory standards while using R</strong>. This includes universities, NGOs, and regulated industries such as <strong>agriculture, finance, insurance, and biotech</strong>. Wherever R is used in regulated or quality-sensitive contexts, the repository can provide assurance and clarity.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-will-we-deliver" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-will-we-deliver">What Will We Deliver?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tools for periodic assessment</strong> of public R packages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Template projects for in-house deployments</strong>, for organizations managing private packages</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>supplementary repository of metadata</strong> that supports the risk-assessment and governance of R environments in regulated settings</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôre deeply grateful to everyone who has contributed so far ‚Äî your work has laid the foundation for what‚Äôs next.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-open-source" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-open-source">Why Open Source?</h3>
<p>You might wonder: <em>‚ÄúIf some industries have the resources to build software, why do open-source projects still rely on funding and volunteer contributions?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Open Source thrives on collaboration rooted in <strong>transparency and trust</strong>. The solutions created in this space aren‚Äôt owned by any one company‚Äîthey belong to the <strong>global community</strong>. That‚Äôs what makes them so powerful.</p>
<p>Across all industries, there are countless <strong>smaller companies, research institutes, non-profits, and independent teams</strong> with brilliant ideas but limited budgets. Without access to costly, proprietary tools, their growth and potential impact are often restricted. Open Source breaks down these barriers‚Äîenabling them to move faster, innovate, and build on <strong>trusted, freely available technologies</strong>.</p>
<p>While large enterprises do support Open Source‚Äîby funding organizations like the <strong>R Consortium</strong>, sponsoring events, or encouraging their employees to contribute‚Äîthese efforts are often <strong>indirect</strong>. Open Source may not be owned, but it still needs to be built, maintained, and evolved. And that takes real resources.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where <strong>non-profit organizations and community fundraising</strong> play a vital role. They help fuel projects that are developed in parallel by volunteers around the world. Open Source isn‚Äôt free to create‚Äîit‚Äôs just <strong>freely shared</strong>. Ongoing support from both the community and companies that benefit from it is essential to keep it growing.</p>

<section id="contribute-now-to-support-open-source-software" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contribute-now-to-support-open-source-software">Contribute now to support Open Source Software</h3>
<p>Fundraising initiatives help direct resources to high-impact projects‚Äî<strong>accelerating innovation, expanding access, and ensuring that open collaboration remains a driving force for progress</strong>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs build this resource together ‚Äî for the benefit of the entire R community and every organization that relies on it to meet regulatory standards. üëâ <a href="https://pharmar.org/repository">https://pharmar.org/repository</a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-about-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Yes, we‚Äôve been involved in this group for about two years now. Initially, it was run by someone named Kamilla, who later moved to another university, and her role was taken over by Martin. Martin has been doing an excellent job leading the group, which mainly serves postgraduates, teaching staff, and research staff‚Äîreally anyone enthusiastic about learning R and improving their skills, including a lot of newcomers.</p>
<p>When I first joined, my main goal was to improve my own R skills. Before that, I had been a helper in some R courses taught by the university, but I felt I could learn more and benefit from being part of a supportive community. The group is full of volunteers who are passionate about R and programming in general. They‚Äôre always willing to share their knowledge and help one another, which has been incredibly valuable. This spirit of sharing and collaboration creates a fantastic environment, especially in a university setting where research thrives on collective learning.</p>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> I joined the group about two years ago. I had only been using R for about six months before that, so I didn‚Äôt have much experience with it. Our group had only a handful of people who knew R, and two of them left the University shortly after. Suddenly I found myself needing to support researchers who ran into issues with R, as well as managing projects like our pilot Shiny server. We had to find ways to support these types of projects. The R User Group became a valuable resource for us to stay connected with researchers actively using R and to continue learning the language ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan:</strong> I am a PhD student in evolution and ecology. When the R.U.M group was restarted, a general email was sent to the university. As someone who enjoys mentoring younger lab group members in R and learning about new R tools, I was interested in helping restart the group.</p>
<p><strong>Stavrina:</strong> As a Data Scientist and Data Visualization enthusiast, I used to run our Data Visualisation Club monthly meetups. I have taken a step back, but I was involved in the group‚Äôs initial creation and help a bit with organizing and strategizing now.</p>

<section id="can-you-share-what-the-local-r-community-is-like" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-local-r-community-is-like">Can you share what the local R Community is like?</h2>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> The university‚Äôs local community is mostly composed of postgraduates, along with some researchers who are starting to use R in their work. Everyone in the community is very enthusiastic, eager to learn, and focused on improving their skills. It‚Äôs a highly motivated and self-sustaining group. Everyone in the R community is very friendly and welcoming. It‚Äôs a great, supportive environment.</p>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> Most people in our R community come from humanities backgrounds. There‚Äôs a group in health economics that uses R extensively, as well as some in psychology and language studies. We also have a large group in genomics. It feels like there‚Äôs a wide range of experience‚Äîsome researchers have been working with R for a long time, while many postgraduates are just starting to learn. As a group, it can be challenging to support both experienced users and beginners, but we do our best to meet everyone‚Äôs needs.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan:</strong> The local R community exists at multiple levels. It is often most active at a small scale within research groups, where members share advice. At the university level, R.U.M. brings together people from a broader variety of backgrounds. There is also a city-wide R community in Manchester, where quarterly talks are organized by <a href="https://datacove.co.uk/">Datacove</a>. These events bring together people from industry, public health, academia, and more.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-had-a-meetup-on-r-functions-for-visualization.-can-you-share-more-about-the-topic-covered-why-this-topic">You had a Meetup on ‚Äú<a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-users-group-uni-manchester/events/303918144/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events">R Functions [for visualization]</a>.‚Äù Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic?</h2>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> Our previous event hadn‚Äôt gone as well as we hoped. We tried to cover a pretty complex topic‚Äîreproducible science using R on a Docker container with renv‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt very well attended. So, we decided to shift our focus to beginner users and cover some basics that every R user should know but that we‚Äôve noticed many beginners struggle with. The event covered the basics of function syntax and organizing code with functions. We also had a second talk that was a bit more advanced, focusing on using functions with the <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html">purrr map function</a> to automate plot production. The goal was to attract a broader range of users, as our previous events have mainly catered to advanced users.</p>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> We‚Äôve noticed that many users haven‚Äôt been responding to the more advanced topics. In general, though, making code readable is crucial, especially for researchers who need others to reproduce their work. If the code is hard to understand, it complicates reproducibility, but organizing code with functions makes it much clearer. This is an essential aspect of programming, and it also ties into plotting, which is one of the most requested skills among students. Most students using R for research will need to create plots to convey complex conclusions and ideas. Plots are much more effective than raw data alone, and R produces some of the best visualizations out there. Even organizations like the <a href="https://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a> use R for their high-quality graphs, so it‚Äôs a valuable and widely-used skill.</p>
<p><strong>Stavrina:</strong> A barrier to entry in any programming language or tool is sometimes seeing demonstrable evidence of how it can be useful to an individual, especially at undergraduate and early postgraduate level. Working within a University and Research environment, we all have to make plots and advanced visualizations. Sometimes, though, the extra step is standardizing and making that reproducible for high-throughput plotting. Combining visualizations with functions achieves just that and can serve as a practical and aspirational demonstration for our community.</p>

(Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people that are unable to attend physical events in the future?</h2>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> One technique we started using since COVID is hybrid teaching. We initially used Zoom, but then switched to Teams. This approach has been very inclusive because it allows people in distant locations, even in other countries, or those with long commutes to participate in our talks. In the past, everyone had to be physically on campus, which excluded those who lived further away. Now, with hybrid teaching, more people can join in, regardless of their location.</p>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> Yes, we‚Äôve noticed that this might have been part of the issue. Our last talk was advertised as in-person only because it was meant to be hands-on, Carpentry-style training. That may have contributed to the low attendance. It definitely makes a difference‚Äîwhen we make an event hybrid, we tend to get a lot more participation.</p>
<p><strong>Stavrina:</strong> We use conferencing software for all our meetings and make the invitation open to anyone outside the organization, we are lucky that we have access to meeting spaces that have suitable equipment for running hybrid meetings.</p>

<section id="what-trends-do-you-currently-see-in-r-language-and-your-industry-any-trends-you-see-developing-in-the-near-future" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-trends-do-you-currently-see-in-r-language-and-your-industry-any-trends-you-see-developing-in-the-near-future">What trends do you currently see in R language and your industry? Any trends you see developing in the near future?</h2>
<p><strong>Tony:</strong> Researchers and academic programs are increasingly looking to include R and RStudio in their teaching and research for two main reasons. First, data regulations have become much stricter over the past couple of years, and with R, you have complete control over where your data is stored. You know it‚Äôs not in the cloud or being transferred to any external organization, which helps in meeting university data compliance standards.</p>
<p>The second reason for the shift towards R is that it‚Äôs free from licensing restrictions. With some other software, licensing can be highly restrictive‚Äîyou might only be allowed to use it in certain countries, like the UK, or only on campus. R, on the other hand, offers a more inclusive environment for research, allowing access without these geographic or licensing limitations. This flexibility is a big part of why R is becoming so popular within the research community.</p>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> I completely agree. I couldn‚Äôt have put it better myself, but as Tony pointed out, R is becoming more and more popular. It‚Äôs gaining broader appeal and is now appreciated as a general scientific programming language rather than just a niche statistical tool. There‚Äôs a clear trend, as Tony described, toward open science and open source software, and R is becoming a significant part of that movement.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan:</strong> One big trend is the use of LLMs/AI both for writing code in R, and as a tool executed through R. We were really lucky to have a former R users group member, <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/rsg/staff/kamilla-kopec-harding">Kamilla Kopec-Harding</a>, return to give a talk on both of these perspectives earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Sian:</strong> R remains relatively niche and widely recognized in bioinformatics, clinical trials, fintech, and marketing. However, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadleywickham/">Hadley Wickham</a> and others‚Äô contributions - through the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> and packages like <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr,</a> <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, and <a href="https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/">roxygen2</a> - have significantly broadened R‚Äôs appeal and impact in recent years. From an anecdotal perspective, about a decade ago, it was rare to see job postings requiring R skills. Today, although R may not have the same reach as languages like Python, job searches for R roles now yield far more opportunities than before.</p>

  <title>Tidy topological machine learning with TDAvec and tdarec</title>
  <dc:creator>Jason Cory Brunson, Alexsei Luchinsky, Umar Islambekov</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/tidy-topological-machine-learning-with-tdavec-and-tdarec/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="the-pitch" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pitch">The Pitch</h2>
<p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is a pretty mature discipline at this point, but in the last several years its assimilation into machine learning (ML) has really taken off. Based on our experience, the plurality of experimental TDA tools are written in Python, and naturally Python is home to most of these applications.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not to say that there are no R packages for TDA-ML. <a href="https://github.com/kisungyou/TDAkit">{TDAkit}</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shaelebrown/TDApplied">{TDApplied}</a>, and others provide tools for specific self-contained analyses and could be used together in larger projects. As with the broader R ecosystem, though, their integration can require some additional work. The combination of several low-level libraries and compounding package dependencies has also made this toolkit fragile, with several packages temporarily or permanently archived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/">Tidymodels</a> package collection has enabled a new generation of users, myself (JCB) included, to build familiarity and proficiency with conventional ML. By harmonizing syntax and smoothing pipelines, Tidymodels makes it quick and easy to adapt usable code to new data types, pre-processing steps, and model families. By using wrappers and extractors, it also allows seasoned users to extend their work beyond its sphere of convenience.</p>
<p>We therefore think that Tidymodels is an ideal starting point for a more sustained and interoperable collection for TDA-ML in R. Since much of the role of TDA in ML has been to extract and vectorize features from spatial, image, and other high-dimensional data, we present an extension to <a href="https://recipes.tidymodels.org/">{recipes}</a> for just this purpose. Assembling a comprehensive, general-purpose toolkit is a long-term project. Our contribution is meant to spur that project on.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-packages">The Packages</h2>
<p>We present two packages: {TDAvec}, an interface to several efficient feature vectorizations, and {tdarec}, a {recipes} + <a href="https://dials.tidymodels.org/">{dials}</a> extension that integrates these vectorizations into Tidymodels. First, though, we need to introduce persistent homology and how it can be computed with R.</p>
<section id="computations-of-persistent-homology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computations-of-persistent-homology">Computations of persistent homology</h3>
<p>In predictive modeling, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology"><strong>persistent homology</strong></a> (PH) is the workhorse of TDA.<sup>1</sup> In a nutshell, it measures topological patterns in data‚Äîmost commonly clusters and enclosures‚Äîby the range of resolutions through which they persist. Several packages interface to lower-level libraries that compute PH for various data structures‚Äîall accept point clouds and distance matrices, but other structures are accepted where noted:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vectorizations-of-persistent-homology">Vectorizations of persistent homology</h3>
<p>Vectorization is a crucial step to bridge TDA and ML. Numerous methods have been proposed, and research shows that ML performance on a specific task can depend strongly on the chosen method. Therefore, it is highly desirable to compare several approaches to a given problem and select the one found to be best-suited to it.</p>
<p>Although most proposed vectorization methods are available in free software, they are scattered across various R and Python packages. This complicates the comparison process, as researchers must search for available methods and adapt their code to the interface of each specific implementation. The goal of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=TDAvec">{TDAvec}</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Luchinsky2025">(Luchinsky and Islambekov 2025)</span> is to address this issue.</p>
<p>We (AL and UI) have consolidated all currently available vectorizations (of which we are aware) and implemented them in a single R library. Some of these vectorizations are parameter-free, but others rely on one or several hyperparameters. For ease of comparison, we also use a consistent interface, with a common camelcase naming convention, e.g.&nbsp;<code>computePersistenceLandscape()</code>. Additionally, several new vectorization methods developed by our group are also available within the TDAvec framework.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is how to compute the tropical coordinates proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Kalisnik2019">Kali≈°nik (2019)</span> and a coarse vectorization of our own persistence block transformation <span class="citation" data-cites="Chan2022">(Chan et al. 2022)</span> for the degree-1 layer of the persistence diagram above:</p>

<p>{recipes} is the pre-processing arm of Tidymodels; mostly it provides <code>step_*()</code> functions that pipe together as recipe specifications, to later be applied directly to data or built into workflows. {dials} provides tuning functions for these steps as well as for model families provided by {parsnip}.</p>
<p><a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/tdarec/">{tdarec}</a> provides two primary families of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Steps to <em>calculate persistent homology from data</em>, which share the naming pattern <code>step_pd_*()</code> for <strong>p</strong>ersistence <strong>d</strong>iagram. These steps rely on the engines above and are scoped according to the underlying mathematical object encoded in the data: Currently the {ripserr} engine handles point clouds (encoded as coordinate matrices or distance matrices) and rasters (encoded as numerical arrays). These steps accept list-columns of data sets and return list-columns of persistence diagrams.</li>
<li>Steps to <em>transform and vectorize persistence diagrams</em>, which share the naming pattern <code>step_vpd_*()</code> for <strong>v</strong>ectorized <strong>p</strong>ersistence <strong>d</strong>iagram. These steps rely on {TDAvec} and are scoped as there by transformation. They accept list-columns of persistence diagrams and return numeric columns (sometimes flattened from matrix output, e.g.&nbsp;multi-level persistence landscapes) that can be used by most predictive model families.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is how to incorporate PH (using the default Vietoris‚ÄìRips filtration) and the persistence block transformation above into a pre-processing recipe:</p>

<p>The code chunk uses the additional step <code>step_pd_degree()</code> to extract degree-specific layers from multi-degree persistence diagrams; in this case, we are interested in vectorizing only 2-dimensional features. Despite this, we must also specify the degree of the features we want in the persistence block step.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The R Consortium‚Äôs Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) is proud to announce the first round of 2025 grant recipients. These projects represent a dynamic cross-section of innovation in R infrastructure‚Äîranging from economic policy tools and ecological data pipelines to foundational software engineering improvements. Selected from a competitive pool of proposals, the following seven initiatives will receive support to enhance and expand the capabilities of the R ecosystem.</p>
<section id="econdataverse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="econdataverse">econdataverse</h3>
<p>Lead: Christoph Scheuch, Christopher C. Smith, and Teal Emery<br>
Grant: $10,000</p>
<p>The econdataverse initiative was conceived as a unified ecosystem of packages for economic data access and analysis from sources like the IMF, World Bank, and OECD. By enforcing consistent function naming, tidy data formats, and cross-source compatibility, the project will work to significantly reduce the time spent on data acquisition and preparation and facilitate the creation of reproducible workflows. This work will support economic policy development through reproducible data workflows.</p>
</section>
<section id="maimer-unifying-camera-trap-data-in-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maimer-unifying-camera-trap-data-in-r">Maimer ‚Äì Unifying Camera Trap Data in R</h3>
<p>Leads: Stanislas Mahussi Gandaho, Marcus Rowcliffe, and Damiano Oldoni<br>
Grant: $12,000</p>
<p>An integrated R ecosystem for camera trap data analysis in ecology; the project aims to develop standardized interfaces to connect maimer with key packages (activity, camtrapDensity, camtraptor) and ensure compatibility with common data standards like Camera Trap Metadata Standard (CTMS). The project combines visualization, data transformation, and deep-learning-based animal detection in a tidyverse-friendly package.</p>
</section>
<section id="bridging-worlds-enhancing-r-igraph-with-c-core-innovations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridging-worlds-enhancing-r-igraph-with-c-core-innovations">Bridging Worlds: Enhancing R igraph with C Core Innovations</h3>
<p>Lead: David Schoch, Kirill M√ºller, Ma√´lle Salmon<br>
Grant: $16,000</p>
<p>The ISC has previously granted funds in support of the igraph package. This round will support upgrades to igraph to include improved C core integration and improved documentation. You can contribute to the igraph package which is approaching its 1.0 release.</p>
</section>
<section id="r-package-binaries-for-linux-community-edition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-package-binaries-for-linux-community-edition">R Package Binaries for Linux ‚Äì Community Edition</h3>
<p>Lead: Dr.&nbsp;Patrick Schratz<br>
Grant: $10,000</p>
<p>Establish an R-based, open-source build system for R package binaries including the build processes (running in CI) of the publicly running service building CRAN package binaries. The build system is expected to be able to build packages for (common) Linux distributions and multiple architectures (for the start x86 and arm64, riscv64). The goal of the project is to increase installation speed and improve accessibility across Linux environments.</p>
</section>
<section id="fast-linter-for-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fast-linter-for-r">Fast Linter for R</h3>
<p>Lead: Etienne Bacher<br>
Grant: $4,000</p>
<p>The project proposes to write a new linter for the R language that is fast and can apply automatic fixes. Eventually, this new linter would be integrated in air, a fast formatter for R code written entirely in Rust and created by Posit PBC.</p>
</section>
<section id="reviving-redoc" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reviving-redoc">Reviving redoc</h3>
<p>Lead: Noam Ross in partnership with The Tribal Exchange Network Group (TXG)<br>
Grant: $10,000</p>
<p>This project will revive and enhance the R package <strong>redoc</strong>, designed to bridge the critical gap between reproducible R reporting workflows (R Markdown, Quarto) and the collaborative editing environment of Microsoft Word. Currently, generating Word documents from R is largely a one-way process, creating friction when collaborating with colleagues who use Word‚Äôs Track Changes features for feedback. <strong>redoc</strong> enables a unique <em>two-way</em> synchronization, allowing R users to incorporate edits made in Word back into their source R Markdown documents.</p>
</section>
<section id="enhancing-webchem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enhancing-webchem">Enhancing webchem</h3>
<p>Lead: Tam√°s Stirling, Eric Scott (contributor), Eduard Sz√∂cs (original package author)<br>
Grant: $8,500</p>
<p>The project proposes enabling offline access to chemical databases, empowering chemistry professionals with faster, more reliable, and reproducible access to chemical data. They propose to develop functions that provide access to more data to strengthen the core purpose of that package ‚Äì to provide easy access to chemical data.</p>
</section>
<section id="updates-on-our-top-level-projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="updates-on-our-top-level-projects">Updates on our Top-Level Projects</h2>
<p>Every so often, the ISC awards a project the status of Top-Level Project. This is a 3-year commitment to support the project. We do this when we believe that a project is fundamentally necessary to support the infrastructure of the language ‚Äì how it is developed or distributed ‚Äì or the project is fundamentally necessary to support the community ‚Äì to help it grow and engage new audiences.</p>
<section id="r-ladies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-ladies">R-Ladies+</h3>
<p>R-Ladies is a global organization that promotes gender diversity in the R programming community. It supports and empowers individuals of underrepresented genders through events, training, mentorship, and community-building initiatives. In 2025, R-Ladies will continue the core mission of supporting and growing a diverse R community while embarking on several exciting new initiatives. We will rebrand as R-Ladies+, updating our logo and visual identity across all platforms. To support this transition, we‚Äôll develop a branding kit for chapters to easily apply the new look locally.</p>
<p>In May 2025 R-Ladies supports 244 chapters in 68 countries with 108,205 members. The organization is run 100% by volunteer effort. <a href="https://rladies.org/">The website</a> will continue featuring R-Ladies, chapters, news and blog posts, and we‚Äôll begin translating key content into Spanish, French, and Portuguese. We‚Äôll <a href="https://guide.rladies.org">keep improving our internal processes</a> by automating routine tasks, freeing up volunteer time for activities that help our members thrive.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-universe">R-Universe</h3>
<p><a href="https://r-universe.dev/search">The R-universe platform</a> continues to grow at a healthy pace to balance stability, new features, and maintainability of the project. Here are some of the most recent updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed ARM64 support on Linux: R-universe now builds and checks MacOS/Linux binaries for packages with compiled code on both Intel and Arm hardware. Later this year we also plan to start testing with the experimental ARM64 R for Windows.<br>
</li>
<li>The build workflows have been refactored to better decouple the steps of preparing, building and checking a package, and automatically extract warnings and errors as annotations. This makes it easier to see what the problem is when a package fails to build and enables the front-end to deep-link directly to the relevant parts of the build logs on GitHub actions.<br>
</li>
<li>All R-universe infrastructure code under <a href="http://github.com/r-universe-org/">http://github.com/r-universe-org/</a> (workflows, actions, containers, scripts, server code), has been cleaned up, allowing anyone to see how everything works and suggest improvements.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><strong>Frank Hull</strong> is a director of data science &amp; analytics, leading a data science team in the energy sector, an open source contributor, and a developer of <a href="https://github.com/frankiethull/kuzco"><code>{kuzco}</code></a>, an R package that reimagines how image classification and computer vision can be approached using large language models (LLMs). With a passion for building tools that make advanced technology accessible to non-specialists, Frank has also contributed to the R ecosystem through multiple projects, and actively maintains his work on <a href="https://github.com/frankiethull">GitHub</a> and his <a href="https://frankiethull.github.io/about.html">personal site</a>.</p>
<p>In this interview, we explore the ideas behind <code>{kuzco}</code>, its use of LLMs, and how it differs from conventional deep learning frameworks like <code>{keras}</code> and <code>{torch}</code> in R. <code>{kuzco}</code> is open source and Frank states in the interview that the project is actively looking for contributions, both technical and non-technical. Feel free to contact him directly (frankiethull@proton.me for open source connections) to ask questions and find out more.</p>

<section id="what-problem-does-kuzco-solve-that-existing-r-tools-like-keras-or-torch-dont" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-problem-does-kuzco-solve-that-existing-r-tools-like-keras-or-torch-dont">1. What problem does {kuzco} solve that existing R tools like {keras} or {torch} don‚Äôt?</h2>
<p><code>{keras}</code> and <code>{torch}</code> are fantastic tools, but they‚Äôre still rooted in the deep learning mindset. Essentially, they‚Äôre designed to make TensorFlow and PyTorch more accessible‚Äîbut they still expect you to think like a machine learning engineer.</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre doing computer vision with these frameworks, you‚Äôre either building a model from scratch or adapting a pre-trained model by converting your image to a tensor and fitting it into that mold.</p>
<p>With <code>{kuzco}</code>, I wanted to break out of that paradigm entirely. This isn‚Äôt about training models or tuning hyperparameters. <code>{kuzco}</code> is for people‚Äîtechnical or not‚Äîwho want to <em>understand</em> an image, not build a deep learning pipeline. Maybe your boss wants to drop in an image and ask a question about the image without writing code. That‚Äôs the power of combining LLMs with a simple interface.</p>
<p>The goal is to <strong>citizenize</strong> computer vision‚Äîturn it into something that‚Äôs driven by prompts and natural language instead of tensors and training loops.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-kuzco-leverage-large-language-models-llms-differently-from-traditional-image-classification-methods">2. How does {kuzco} leverage large language models (LLMs) differently from traditional image classification methods?</h2>
<p>LLMs <em>are</em> neural networks, just like <code>{keras}</code> or <code>{torch}</code> models‚Äîbut they‚Äôre trained on vastly more data and built to understand context and nuance in language and vision.</p>
<p>Instead of building a model from the ground up, <code>{kuzco}</code> lets you treat the LLM as an overtrained expert. You provide an image and a system prompt that tells the model to behave like a vision assistant. It doesn‚Äôt need re-training or manual feature engineering‚Äîyou just ask it what you want to know.</p>
<p>That completely flips the usual process. You‚Äôre not staging images, defining tensors, or writing your own classifiers. You‚Äôre just describing your intent and letting the LLM take care of the rest.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-some-example-use-cases-where-kuzco-shinesespecially-in-areas-like-sentiment-or-text-extraction">3. What are some example use cases where {kuzco} shines‚Äîespecially in areas like sentiment or text extraction?</h2>
<p>A friend once asked me how to tell whether a tow truck driving past a traffic camera had a car on its bed‚Äîand if so, what kind of car. That‚Äôs incredibly hard to do with traditional computer vision. You‚Äôd need a specialized model, tons of labeled images, and lots of training.</p>
<p>With <code>{kuzco}</code> and an LLM, you can just hand over the image and ask, ‚ÄúIs there a car on this truck? What kind is it?‚Äù The model can return nuanced answers: ‚ÄúIt looks like a silver Toyota Camry.‚Äù</p>
<p>And you can go even further‚Äîask how many eyes are in the image, or where the eyes are located. You get image classification, object recognition, sentiment, and even spatial reasoning‚Äîall without traditional ML pipelines.</p>

<p>Pretty easy. If you have Ollama and R installed, you can use either <code>{pak}</code> or <code>{devtools}</code> to install <code>{kuzco}</code> from GitHub or R-universe. It‚Äôs not on CRAN yet, but everything else you need is in the README.</p>

<p>Right now, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs experimental‚Äîbut promising. I built it as an open-source side project over the holidays, and it unexpectedly caught a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd love to see others contribute. There‚Äôs definitely room to grow: better error handling, output validation, more robust documentation. I‚Äôve only focused on local LLMs through <code>{ellmer}</code> and <code>{ollamar}</code>, but it‚Äôd be pretty simple to add support for OpenAI, Claude, Perplexity, or other hosted LLMs.</p>
<p>If someone wants to help build out those back ends, or even help write better docs, I‚Äôd be thrilled to collaborate. That‚Äôs why I open-sourced it in the first place‚Äîto make something useful and invite others in.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Financial institutions are increasingly looking beyond traditional market risk to quantify and manage more complex forms of risk. <a href="https://r-consortium.org/webinars/quantification-of-participation-risk-using-r-and-rshiny.html">In a recent R Consortium webinar</a>, Goran Lovric, LL.M., and Simon Aigner, MSc, from Raiffeisenlandesbank Ober√∂sterreich (RLB O√ñ) unveiled a novel approach to modeling <em>participation risk</em> using R and R Shiny, empowering banks to analyze value fluctuations in corporate holdings with a reproducible, open-source solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/quantifying-participation-risk-with-r-and-r-shiny-a-new-frontier-in-financial-risk-modeling/goran.jpeg" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/quantifying-participation-risk-with-r-and-r-shiny-a-new-frontier-in-financial-risk-modeling/simon.jpeg" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<section id="from-market-price-to-participation-value" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-market-price-to-participation-value">From Market Price to Participation Value</h2>
<p>‚ÄúParticipation risk,‚Äù explained Lovric, a seasoned expert with over 18 years in international financial risk management, ‚Äúis the risk of changes in <em>value</em>, not price. That‚Äôs the key difference between market risk and participation risk.‚Äù</p>
<p>While traditional market risk models focus on short-term price movements of listed assets, participation risk pertains to long-term value changes in equity participations‚Äîoften in non-listed or strategic holdings.</p>
<p><strong>An End-to-End Framework Using R</strong></p>
<p>The webinar provided an in-depth look at a full-stack modeling approach‚Äîfrom data sourcing to Shiny dashboard deployment. Aigner, an economic and business analytics professional at RLB O√ñ, walked attendees through the process of acquiring live financial data using R packages and web scraping techniques.</p>
<p>Using the <code>ecb</code> R package, participants saw how to fetch interest rate curves directly from the European Central Bank. Then, leveraging web scraping with packages like <code>rvest</code>, <code>stringr</code>, and <code>xml2</code>, Aigner demonstrated how to extract key financial statements‚Äîsuch as cash flow data‚Äîfrom sources like Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>These datasets form the foundation for estimating future cash flows and cost of equity, key components in the discounted cash flow model used to simulate value at risk (VaR) for participations.</p>

<section id="the-r-and-shiny-app-simulation-reporting-and-deployment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-r-and-shiny-app-simulation-reporting-and-deployment">The R and Shiny App: Simulation, Reporting, and Deployment</h2>
<p>Lovric emphasized the importance of simulating volatilities and correlations across sectors using peer data. ‚ÄúOnce you have the right inputs‚Äîcash flow volatility, cost of capital, sector correlations‚Äîyou can generate both diversified and non-diversified risk measures,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>All of these capabilities are built into a custom R Shiny app that the speakers have generously made available under an MIT open license. Users can upload structured input files containing valuations, cash flow data, and cost of equity estimates, and the app runs Monte Carlo simulations to quantify value at risk (VaR) under different correlation scenarios.</p>
<p>One striking example from the presentation illustrated the power of diversification. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say a portfolio is worth ‚Ç¨1.7 billion. If you ignore sector correlations, you‚Äôd get a risk of ‚Ç¨9.9 billion‚Äî58%,‚Äù Lovric explained. ‚ÄúBut if you incorporate actual correlations across different sectors, that drops to about ‚Ç¨750 million, or 44.5%, over a one-year, 99.9% confidence interval.‚Äù</p>
<p>The tool includes a database-backed architecture for scalability, and Lovric detailed how it can be deployed on an internal server with a few additional scripts. This ensures compliance with banking regulations while preserving accessibility for teams across departments.<img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/quantifying-participation-risk-with-r-and-r-shiny-a-new-frontier-in-financial-risk-modeling/demo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<p>By combining reproducibility, open data, and advanced modeling, the work of Lovric and Aigner illustrates the transformative potential of R in the finance sector. As Lovric noted, ‚ÄúThis is not a black-box model. Everything‚Äîfrom the scraping scripts to the simulation logic‚Äîis transparent and modifiable.‚Äù</p>
<p>The full source code and Shiny app are available via Goran‚Äôs webinar repository (linked below). From finance to development, the Quantification of Participation Risk project offers a compelling blueprint for modern risk infrastructure.</p>

<p>At a <a href="https://r-consortium.org/webinars/rix-reproducible-data-science-environments-with-nix.html">recent R Medicine webinar hosted by the R Consortium</a>, Bruno Rodrigues, Head of the Statistics and Data Strategy Departments at Luxembourg‚Äôs Ministry of Research and Higher Education, presented an innovative approach to reproducibility in R: one that eliminates the complexity of containerization, works seamlessly across systems, and offers analysis reproducibility for years into the future.</p>

<section id="the-challenge-of-reproducibility-in-data-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge-of-reproducibility-in-data-science">The Challenge of Reproducibility in Data Science</h3>
<p>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, yet achieving it in data science remains challenging. Rodrigues explains that reproducibility is on a continuum and depends on 4 factors: the version of R, package versions, operating systems, and hardware. Traditional tools like <code>{renv}</code> capture R package dependencies but fall short in tracking system-level libraries or the R interpreter itself. In my own work, I‚Äôve utilized <code>{renv}</code>to import packages for implementing tables for R-powered websites. Containerization tools like Docker offer more comprehensive encapsulation but come with their own complexities and do not guarantee deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Rodrigues emphasized that true reproducibility requires capturing the entire computational environment, including system libraries, compilers, and the operating system. This holistic approach ensures that analyses can be rerun with identical results, regardless of changes in the software ecosystem.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nix-a-functional-package-manager-for-reproducible-builds">Nix: A Functional Package Manager for Reproducible Builds</h3>
<p>Nix is a cross-platform package manager designed for reproducibility. It allows users to define environments declaratively, ensuring that builds are deterministic and environments can be recreated identically across different systems and over time. Nix manages not just R packages but also system dependencies, making it a comprehensive solution for reproducible research.</p>
<p>Rodrigues highlighted that Nix‚Äôs approach to package management eliminates issues related to hidden dependencies and environment drift, common pitfalls in data science workflows.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNix really makes it possible to reach this gold standard of reproducibility.‚Äù</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introducing-rix-bridging-r-and-nix">Introducing <code>{rix}</code>: Bridging R and Nix</h3>
<p>To make Nix more accessible to R users, Rodrigues developed <code>{rix}</code>, an R package that simplifies the creation of reproducible environments using Nix. With <code>{rix}</code>, users can generate Nix expressions directly from R, specifying the R version, required packages, system dependencies, and preferred IDEs.</p>
<p>The core function, <code>rix()</code>, generates a <code>default.nix</code> file, which Nix uses to build the environment. This process ensures that the entire software stack, from the R interpreter to system libraries, is captured and can be reproduced reliably.</p>

<section id="the-magic-of-rix" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-magic-of-rix">The ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù of <code>{rix}</code></h3>
<p>One of the standout features of <code>{rix}</code> is its ability to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù environments in time. By specifying a particular date, users can recreate the exact state of CRAN and Bioconductor repositories as they existed on that day. This temporal pinning ensures that analyses remain reproducible, even as packages evolve.</p>
<p>Rodrigues described this capability as the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of <code>{rix}</code>, allowing researchers to maintain consistent environments without manual intervention.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="key-advantages-of-rix" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-advantages-of-rix">Key Advantages of <code>{rix}</code></h3>
<p>Rodrigues highlighted two critical benefits of using <code>{rix}</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>No Need for Pre-installed R</strong>: Once the Nix expression is generated, the environment can be built using Nix alone, eliminating the need for R to be pre-installed on the system. This feature is particularly useful for deploying environments on CI/CD systems or sharing with collaborators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seamless Integration with Docker</strong>: While Nix ensures reproducibility, Docker offers portability. <code>{rix}</code> allows users to wrap Nix-built environments into Docker containers, combining the strengths of both tools for long-term preservation and distribution.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="real-world-applications-and-future-developments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="real-world-applications-and-future-developments">Real-world Applications and Future Developments</h3>
<p>Rodrigues demonstrated how <code>{rix}</code> can be used to create environments that include IDEs like RStudio or VS Code, as well as additional languages like Python and Rust. One example where <code>{rix}</code> could come into play is the R Consortium website, which is published using Quarto, and uses RStudio and <code>{renv}</code> as a main part of the workflow. The content is pushed to GitHub where it‚Äôs published using GitHub Actions. These environments can be deployed across various platforms, including CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistent and reproducible workflows.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rodrigues is developing <code>{rixpress}</code>, a companion package inspired by <code>{targets}</code>. <code>{rixpress}</code> aims to facilitate the creation of reproducible analytical pipelines, further enhancing the capabilities of <code>{rix}</code> and Nix in data science projects.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="getting-started-with-rix" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started-with-rix">Getting Started with <code>{rix}</code></h3>
<p>To begin using <code>{rix}</code>, install the package from CRAN:</p>
<p>R<br>
Copy code<br>
<code>install.packages("rix")</code></p>
<p>Then, generate a Nix expression for your project:</p>
<p>R<br>
Copy code<br>
<code>library(rix)</code></p>
<p><code>rix(</code><br>
<code>date = "2024-12-14",</code><br>
<code>r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),</code><br>
<code>system_pkgs = NULL,</code><br>
<code>git_pkgs = NULL,</code><br>
<code>ide = "code",</code><br>
<code>project_path = ".",</code><br>
<code>overwrite = TRUE,</code><br>
<code>print = TRUE</code><br>
<code>)</code></p>
<p>This command creates a <code>default.nix</code> file and an <code>.Rprofile</code>, setting up a reproducible environment tailored to your project‚Äôs needs.</p>

<section id="topological-data-analysis-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topological-data-analysis-in-r">Topological data analysis in R</h2>
<p>Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing field that uses techniques from algebraic topology to analyze the shape and structure of data. At its core, TDA provides tools to understand the geometric and topological features of datasets across multiple scales, with persistent homology (PH) being one of its fundamental techniques.</p>
<p>Several R packages have emerged to provide TDA capabilities to the R community, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=TDA">{TDA}</a> which focuses on statistical analysis of PH and density clustering by providing an R interface for the efficient algorithms of the C++ libraries <a href="https://project.inria.fr/gudhi/software/">GUDHI</a>, <a href="https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/">Dionysus</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/phat-code/phat/">PHAT</a>.

<p>While these packages have made TDA more accessible, they‚Äôve also introduced different data structures for representing persistence data, creating challenges for interoperability and workflow consistency. Moreover, workflows using tools from different packages will rely on some of the same low-level operations, like computing PH and calculating distances between persistence diagrams. When each package is built for purpose, this will lead to either duplication or cascading dependencies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/">{phutil}</a> package addresses such fragmentation by providing a unified toolbox for handling persistence data. It offers consistent data structures and methods that work seamlessly with outputs from various TDA packages. As part of the <a href="https://github.com/tdaverse">TDAverse</a> initiative, {phutil} contributes to creating a coherent ecosystem for topological data analysis in R.</p>

<p>The {phutil} <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/articles/validation-benchmark.html#definitions">documentation</a> provides an overview of persistent homology. For now, know that the result of this procedure is a <strong>persistence diagram</strong>: a multiset (set with multiplicity) of points in the plane‚Äîusually the upper-half plane and most often the first quadrant. Persistence diagrams encode topological features of different dimensions, and a single diagram may encode features of one or all dimensions. By <strong>persistence data</strong>, we mean a data structure that encodes diagrams of all dimensions, and possibly many diagrams coming from data sets of a common type.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementations-in-phutil">Implementations in {phutil}</h2>
<p>The {phutil} package aims at serving as a low-level package that defines a unifying toolbox for handling persistence data. This section describes the class that has been implemented to handle a single persistence diagram as well as the distances between persistence diagrams. The package also provides a class of persistence data that can be used to store multiple diagrams, which is simply a list of persistence diagrams. This class is not described here, but will be the backbone of the forthcoming {inphr} package for making inference on persistence diagrams.</p>
<section id="the-persistence-class" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-persistence-class">The <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/reference/persistence.html"><code>persistence</code></a> class</h3>
<p>The ‚Äòpersistence‚Äô class is a list with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>pairs</code>: A list of 2-column matrices containing birth-death pairs. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i">-<em>th</em> element of the list corresponds to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(i-1)">-<em>th</em> homology dimension. If there is no pairs for a given dimension but there are pairs in higher dimensions, the corresponding element(s) is/are filled with a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0%20%5Ctimes%202"> numeric matrix.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metadata</code>: A list of length 6 containing information about how the data was computed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>orderered_pairs</code>: A boolean indicating whether the pairs in the <code>pairs</code> list are ordered (i.e.&nbsp;the first column is strictly less than the second column).</li>
<li><code>data</code>: The name of the object containing the original data on which the persistence data was computed.</li>
<li><code>engine</code>: The name of the package and the function of this package that computed the persistence data in the form <code>"package_name::package_function"</code>.</li>
<li><code>filtration</code>: The filtration used in the computation in a human-readable format (i.e.&nbsp;full names, capitals where need, etc.).</li>
<li><code>parameters</code>: A list of parameters used in the computation.</li>
<li><code>call</code>: The exact call that generated the persistence data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the following <code>S3</code> methods for objects of class <code>persistence</code> have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>coercers from matrix, data.frame, objects of class ‚Äòdiagram‚Äô as produced by <code>TDA::*Diag()</code> functions, objects of class ‚ÄòPHom‚Äô as produced by <code>ripserr::vietoris_rips()</code> and objects of class ‚Äòhclust‚Äô as produced by <code>stats::hclust()</code>;</li>
<li><code>format()</code> and <code>print()</code> which use the MIT-licensed <a href="https://cli.r-lib.org">{cli}</a> package behind the scene for printing out to the console a nice colourful but brief summary of the persistence data;</li>
<li><code>get_pairs()</code> to extract homological features from a specific dimension;</li>
<li>reverse coercers to go back to either matrix or data.frame representations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more details about how these coercers work can be found in the dedicated <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/articles/persistence-class.html">vignette</a> on the website of the package.</p>
<p>For instance, one can start by some simulated point cloud using the <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/tdaunif/">{tdaunif}</a> package:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distance-computations-using-hera">Distance computations using <a href="https://github.com/anigmetov/hera">Hera</a></h3>
<p>The {phutil} package inlcudes functions to compute bottleneck and Wasserstein distances either between two persistence diagrams or in a pairwise fashion from a set of persistence diagrams. The underlying computation is actually performed via the BSD-licensed <a href="https://github.com/anigmetov/hera"><em>Hera</em></a> C++ library. The latter library is bundled within {phutil} which required a <code>LinkingTo</code> dependency on <a href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/bh.html">{BH}</a> for providing access to the <a href="https://www.boost.org"><em>Boost</em></a> headers for Hera compilation. To this end, the required Boost licensing terms have been copied over with the MIT license terms which {phutil} depends on. Specifically, the following functions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bottleneck_distance()</code> and <code>wasserstein_distance()</code> compute the eponymous distance between two diagrams;</li>
<li><code>bottleneck_pairwise_distances()</code> and <code>wasserstein_pairwise_distances()</code> compute pairwise distances among a sample of persistence diagrams; these functions have their C++ code parallelized via <a href="https://www.openmp.org">OpenMP</a>; to that end, they gain an optional <code>ncores</code> argument which is <code>1L</code> by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, {phutil} has a built-in set of 100 persistence diagrams computed on 100 noisy versions of points on the 2-sphere. The diagrams are stored in the object <a href="https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/reference/persistence_sample.html"><code>persistence_sample</code></a>. The following code computes the pairwise bottleneck distances between the first 7 diagrams in the set:</p>

<p>We are part of a loose-knit team of R developers interested in fostering a more sustainable and convenient package collection for TDA, which we‚Äôve come to call the <a href="https://github.com/tdaverse">TDAverse</a>. The collection ranges from low-level, general-purpose packages like {tdaunif} and now {phutil}, through purpose-fit but interoperable packages like {ripserr} and {plt}, to Tidyverse extensions like {ggtda} and the forthcoming {tdarec}.</p>

<p>Development of {phutil} was directly funded by an Infrastructure Steering Committee grant from the R Consortium, together with several other packages that will be presented in upcoming blog posts. While we hope to secure funding for other specific projects in future, we also invite interested developers or users to reach out with their issues or ideas.</p>

<p>I founded the Unijos R Users Group at Unijos whilst completing my MSc in Field Epidemiology at the University of Jos. The concept emerged from my experience as both a student and a professional Epidemiologist and Data Analyst Activity Manager with <a href="https://www.msf.org/">M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res</a> (MSF). I recognised the critical need for an inclusive community that extended beyond my department of Community Medicine to serve students across all faculties at Unijos. My vision was to create a supportive environment where both undergraduates and postgraduates could develop practical R programming skills applicable to their diverse research interests, regardless of their academic discipline.</p>
<p>Our group initially focused on postgraduate students, but my main goal has been to encourage undergraduates to adopt R for their undergraduate research projects. During my studies, both as an undergraduate and during my MSc in Field Epidemiology, we primarily used IBM SPSS Statistics, which has significant costs. In contrast, R is a free platform, which makes it much more accessible, especially for students in low-income regions like northern Nigeria. Switching from SPSS or other paid software to R would be more cost-effective and sustainable for us.</p>
<p>One of my key initiatives in founding this group is to engage undergraduate students after each session by providing a small incentive, not money, but support for internet access. Many of our members are from various universities across northern Nigeria, and this incentive encourages them to participate in learning R and expand their skills actively.</p>
<p>In my role with MSF, I also encourage my data entry teams and medical data supervisors to use R. Since joining MSF, we‚Äôve started sessions on R, and it‚Äôs been rewarding to see team members learn, create visualisations, and gain insights from the data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-unijos">Can you share what the R community is like in Unijos?</h2>
<p>Our university, the University of Jos, is commonly known as UNIJOS. Since founding this group, I‚Äôve noticed that many who join our community are my MSc colleagues. Initially, there were just seven of us in the MSc Epidemiology program. At that time, we were using software like EpiInfo and SPSS for data analysis and outbreak investigations. Still, I realized the trend was shifting toward R. So, we formed a small group at UNIJOS to learn it together.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/disease-outbreak-mapping-open-source-and-outreach-unijos-r-users-group-in-nigeria-leads-the-way/UnijosRUGlogo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Our community quickly expanded to include students from other programmes, such as MSc Clinical Epidemiology, MSc Chemistry, and MPH (Master of Public Health), who joined us because we offered free and accessible learning sessions. We hold online sessions every two weeks and also organise in-person sessions within our department. Sometimes, after classes, we gather for a session on R. Currently, our focus is on undergraduate students, although we also include postgraduates. We encourage participation across departments and post information on Meetup, WhatsApp, Facebook, and bulletin boards to invite anyone interested. It‚Äôs a free community open to anyone who wants to learn.</p>
<p>Our reach has grown beyond UNIJOS. In our recent online session, I noticed participants from other universities in northern Nigeria, such as Ahmadu Bello University, the Federal University of Health Sciences, Azare, National Open University of Nigeria-Maiduguri Study Centre, and the University of Maiduguri, with many undergraduates joining.</p>
<p>At MSF, I also encourage my team to use R for data analysis and other tasks. This integration has been beneficial, and I‚Äôm thrilled to see more people embracing R both within and outside UNIJOS.</p>

Can you share more about the topic covered? Why this topic?</h2>
<p>During our March 22nd Meetup on Outbreak Mapping in R, we explored the essential role of spatial data visualisation in epidemiological investigations. We covered the workflow from data preparation to creating effective choropleth and spot maps using ggplot2 and the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html">sf</a> packages. We chose this topic because mapping is crucial but often underutilised in outbreak response, helping investigators identify disease clusters and transmission patterns more efficiently. The event targeted public health professionals, residents in community medicine, epidemiologists, and data analysts with basic R knowledge who wanted practical skills for visualising outbreak data in their daily work.</p>

<p>Our sessions were designed to be inclusive of all skill levels, from undergraduate students to professionals interested in learning R. We kept it very basic so that anyone, whether new to R or with some experience, could participate comfortably. I felt that starting with the basics would encourage more people to join and help grow our community, making it accessible and welcoming for everyone. We also hold more advanced R sessions periodically to encourage broader participation.</p>

<p>We primarily use Microsoft Teams for our online sessions, especially to reach participants in remote areas. As I mentioned, our last session included many participants from other universities and locations beyond the University of Jos and Plateau State. Microsoft Teams has been effective for these online sessions due to its ease of use.</p>

<p>Unijos R User Group First Online Meeting Using Microsoft Teams</p>
<p>Looking ahead, once we‚Äôve grown and conducted more sessions, we‚Äôre planning to introduce advanced topics like using <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a>, which I enjoy, and predictive modeling, possibly starting next year. At that point, we‚Äôll also begin using GitHub to manage our data and resources, adding another layer of engagement for the community.</p>
<p>After each online session, we offer participants, especially undergraduates, a small internet token to help with connectivity costs. The program is free, and R Consortium has helped us make it accessible, so we want to keep it that way. Occasionally, if the network on Teams isn‚Äôt reliable, we switch to Google Meet. Additionally, we plan physical sessions for those nearby to foster in-person connections and learning opportunities.</p>

Please tell me a little about yourself, such as your hobbies/interests or anything else you want to share.</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm a medical doctor by training, having graduated from Ahmadu Bello University. My transition from clinical practice to working with data began immediately after my internship, when I developed a strong interest in learning R. Previously, I had been using SPSS. I had even created a platform in Borno State called MTJ Data Analytics to offer free online sessions for SPSS. However, I found that many people struggled with SPSS due to the need for a paid license, and it required a lot of computer resources, making it difficult for those with older or less powerful devices.</p>
<p>Recognising these limitations, I saw the need to shift from SPSS to R, which is free and offers many powerful packages. My love for R grew as I explored its tools, like Shiny for interactive dashboards and the ‚Äò<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html">sf</a>‚Äô package for mapping. These allow for flexible, detailed visualisations in outbreak investigations‚Äîsomething Epi Info and SPSS couldn‚Äôt fully support. R has become my go-to tool, offering a one-stop solution for analysis, mapping, and sampling without needing to switch between different software.</p>
<p>When I applied for my current role at MSF, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the technical requirements were based on R. Looking back, if I hadn‚Äôt learned R, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to secure this position. Recently, the Head of Epidemiology, Dr Franck Ale, from our headquarters even complimented my code, which was an incredibly proud moment and solidified my commitment to R.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm genuinely grateful for the support of the R Consortium, which has enabled us to build and expand this community in northern Nigeria, particularly at the University of Jos. Looking ahead, I plan to expand this platform further to the University of Maiduguri in the Northeast, where there is a need for R communities and support. Thank you for all you do to empower people with these resources and help grow this community‚ÄîI‚Äôm excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamilsijko/">Kamil Sijko</a>, organizer of both the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/spotkania-entuzjastow-r-warsaw-r-users-group-meetup/">R Users and R-Ladies Warsaw groups</a>, recently spoke with the R Consortium about the evolving R community in Poland and the group‚Äôs efforts to connect users across academia, industry, and open-source development. Kamil shared his journey from discovering R as a student to taking over the leadership of the Warsaw R community in 2024. He discussed the group‚Äôs hybrid meetups, industry collaborations with companies like AstraZeneca and Appsilon, and the importance of making R accessible through recorded sessions and international outreach. He also highlighted a recent open-source project on patient randomization, demonstrating how R can be effectively integrated into modern software ecosystems, particularly in medical applications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="please-share-your-background-and-involvement-with-the-rugs-group.">Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</h2>
<p>I first encountered R during my studies, around the time of version 2, well before RStudio existed. I found it an interesting alternative to SPSS, which was widely used at my university. A key figure in my early experience with R was Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbiecek/">Przemyslaw Biecek</a>, whose 2008 book on the language marked my first serious engagement with the software. Since then, I have been using it more extensively across different industries.</p>
<p>Initially, I worked in academia, then moved to government institutions, and now I am in the business sector, all while continuing to use R.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Professor Biecek, who authored the book, later initiated the first meetups for our R community in Warsaw. In 2024, he stepped back from organizing these events and handed over the responsibilities to me‚Äîa passing of the torch that felt especially meaningful, given how I had started.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-share-what-the-r-community-is-like-in-poland">Can you share what the R community is like in Poland?</h2>
<p>Poland is not fundamentally different from any other country in its use of programming languages. R is particularly relevant in academia and specific industries, especially the financial and medical sectors. In the medical field, the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> project plays a significant role, with researchers and pharmaceutical companies heavily relying on it and actively contributing to its development and broader open-source ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, R is strong in geography and geographic computations. Its primary applications are within academia and specific niches outside it, such as the highly regulated medical sector. In this context, R is preferred for regulatory work because it allows rigorous validation to meet industry standards.</p>
<p>In my company, which operates in the medical field, using R is a natural choice. Many algorithms are already implemented in R that are not available in Python, making it logical to utilize R in such cases.</p>

What topics are you hoping to cover? Are your meetings in-person, online, or a hybrid?</h2>
<p>Initially, I planned to host meetings exclusively in person and in Polish, without an online streaming option. However, people expressed interest in re-watching the meetings if they couldn‚Äôt attend. We have a relatively international community of users in Warsaw, so conducting the sessions in English made sense. Consequently, we changed our approach, and now the meetings are hybrid. They are recorded and stored on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq1v6SmgtmJeWDUtIKr0nVw">YouTube</a> channel, allowing anyone to rewatch them if they find them interesting.</p>
<p>We have some significant companies engaged in R development that present fascinating projects. At our last meeting, we hosted representatives from <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.pl/">AstraZeneca</a>, who discussed a large-scale project involving central data validation that utilized R. AstraZeneca also hosted our meetup at their office in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have <a href="https://www.appsilon.com">Appsilon</a>, an active open-source contributor. Though primarily an online organization, many of their team members are based in Warsaw. They have numerous projects to discuss and can provide instruction on various open-source initiatives.</p>
<p>My company, <a href="https://ttsi.com.pl/en/">Transition Technology Science</a>, also works with R and contributes to open-source projects, so there is plenty to discuss. Furthermore, we have a vibrant academic community. The <a href="https://www.mi2.ai/mi2redteam.html">MI2 RedTeam</a> is exploring explainable artificial intelligence, which is both fascinating and crucial right now; others work on packages related to econometrics. This local production and usage create intriguing topics of discussion.</p>
<p>Moreover, we touch upon subjects that address the current state of our community and its prospects, including relevant and active new tools. For example, at the last meetup, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tymoteusz-makowski/">Tymoteusz</a> discussed recent updates to R, including changes to the documentation and the introduction of <a href="https://positron.posit.co/">Positron</a>, the new IDE. These topics are all pertinent and vital.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that R has a distinctive characteristic of being highly relevant in academia, where many projects prioritize exploration and theory over immediate practical applications. However, it offers valuable insights and often sparks meaningful discussions. In one of the first meetings I organized, a participant presented a project that involved network analysis of conspiracy theories using R. This type of work might not align with typical grant criteria. Still, it offered a rich and engaging topic for discussion.</p>
<p>Overall, during these meetings, R often serves as a gateway to deeper and more intriguing areas of science and beyond.</p>

Goal/reason, result, anything interesting, especially related to your industry?</h2>
<p>I‚Äôd like to briefly preview one of the topics I covered in our last meetup, as I was one of the speakers. I discussed a project we completed at my company, which we have <a href="https://ttscience.github.io/unbiased/">open-sourced</a>. This project involves an API for randomization, a perfect example of why R is relevant.</p>
<p>Substantial work has been done in R on advanced randomization methods for clinical trials, including adaptive randomization ‚Äî the kind of functionality that‚Äôs often hard to find elsewhere in such a mature and tested form. So why not use it? At the same time, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect developers building electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) in Python or Java to learn R and integrate it natively into their systems suddenly.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we developed an R package along with a Dockerized API for patient randomization. It runs R in the background, but from the developers‚Äô perspective, integration is straightforward ‚Äî with a decent connection, the whole setup (from ‚Äòdocker pull‚Äô to ‚Äòdocker compose up‚Äô) takes less than a minute. There‚Äôs no need to work directly with R; they simply treat it like any other service in their stack.</p>
<p>This approach represents a promising way forward for many services available in R that can be integrated with other software, making them even more relevant. Modern software architecture often relies on microservices, and there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt use R to build these microservices.</p>
<p>It makes logical sense to position R this way, especially since there is often a lack of tooling for building large-scale applications in R. We have encountered this limitation in other projects. Nevertheless, utilizing R as a microservice provider is a sensible direction.</p>
<p>I see the future of R not only in academic analysis but as a robust backend tool, especially for specific algorithms and statistical procedures that are mature and peer-reviewed. By wrapping R in services that are easy to use from other environments, we make its strengths more accessible to a broader audience without requiring a steep learning curve for engineers or product teams.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebrillantes/">Joe Brillantes</a>, organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-philippines/">R User Group Philippines</a> (RUG-PH), shares how the group has evolved with new interests emerging among its members. From a growing presence of data engineers exploring R to an increasing focus on scientific applications, the group continues to expand its reach. He discussed their upcoming plans for AI-focused meetups, the importance of ethical considerations in predictive modeling, and their efforts to support members in software engineering and analytics.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/data-engineering-scientific-applications-and-ai-inside-r-user-group-philippines-growth/RUG-PHAnniversary.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><em>RUG-PH 11th Anniversary Celebration 14th August 2024</em></p>
<p><strong>Since we last spoke, how has the R User Group Philippines evolved?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, we‚Äôre doing well. Since we last spoke, several themes have emerged that I‚Äôd like to highlight.</p>
<p>First, there‚Äôs a renewed interest in R, but this time, it‚Äôs coming from data engineers and individuals interested in data more broadly. Our meetups typically see one to three first-time attendees who are members of Data Engineering Filipinas. Their interest in R often stems from a desire to explore data professions.</p>
<p>Another theme is that we‚Äôve had several speakers focused on scientific applications of R. For instance, our last speaker, who presented last month, discussed <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-philippines/events/305760876/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">mycology</a> and how R is used to analyze the colors of fungi, which was quite fascinating. We also had an online presentation from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-philippines/events/296013229/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">Jayson V. Pagaduan</a>, a director at a hospital in the U.S. He talked about how R produces efficient test results and research and which tests could be modified, eliminated, or made more efficient to ensure consistent outcomes.</p>
<p>Another speaker, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-philippines/events/296013233/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">Dr.&nbsp;Pauline Del Mundo</a>, was also involved in public health research and discussed how R is applied in her work. This shift toward scientific topics is interesting because many of our previous speakers had backgrounds more aligned with the industry‚Äôs business side.</p>
<p>Lastly, we recorded all our meetups last year, which are now available for those who couldn‚Äôt attend due to time differences. While we haven‚Äôt made these recordings public on YouTube yet, we‚Äôve shared them with attendees who missed the sessions. We also hosted a co-meetup with the <a href="https://ghana-rusers.org/">Ghana R Users Community</a>, where I co-hosted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francis-mensah-23b3262b5/?originalSubdomain=gh">Francis Mensah</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samueltandoh/">Samuel Tandoh</a>, and we spoke about the swirl package.</p>
<p>These themes reflect the developments we‚Äôve observed since our last conversation.</p>
<p><strong>What topics do you plan to cover in the upcoming months?</strong></p>
<p>This year, we have some exciting plans for the forthcoming months, mainly focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models. We‚Äôve received numerous questions on implementing generative AI, not limited to large language models. Therefore, we aim to hold discussions over the next three months.</p>
<p>We have a Dynamic Programming in R planned for April. However, we will introduce a speaker each month in May and June, covering various aspects of AI. In May, a speaker will provide insights into the current state of AI research in the Philippines. In June, another speaker will discuss what it means when people claim that large language models can reason. Lastly, we plan to host a panel discussion in July featuring speakers from previous months and additional guests.</p>
<p>The July meetup will culminate the discussions on ethics and governance in AI. We want to address questions about how to critically evaluate claims made by AI companies and understand their significance. This discussion will not be limited to large language models but will also encompass generative AI and analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Your group has planned multiple meetups on artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics in the coming months. What inspired this focus, and what can attendees expect?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve had conversations with a beginner in our group working on fraud detection. While he‚Äôs enthusiastic about transitioning into his new career, I‚Äôve noticed some questionable methodologies in his approach. It‚Äôs crucial to emphasize that while predictive models can indicate possible fraud, it is a significant difference to outright accuse someone of committing fraud based on those predictions. We must highlight the ethical implications of building models and their potential impact on people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<p>In our upcoming virtual meetups, we will also explore how the Philippines can advance the AI conversation within the country. Although not directly related to R programming, this dialogue will benefit our members by helping them become more informed and discerning about AI.</p>
<p>After this series, we plan to return to topics related to software engineering practices, as many of our members have expressed concerns about coding practices. Though I am not a programmer, my background is more analytical, and this focus will benefit our community. We aim to present a series of talks addressing these software engineering challenges and providing valuable insights.</p>
<p>My goal is not just to have very clean code. I‚Äôm also interested in how different groups can collaborate to make our code easier for software engineers to deploy and more scalable.</p>
<p>One insight I‚Äôve gained during these discussions is that, given R‚Äôs versatility, we could cover an entire year of software engineering topics in R. However, focusing solely on software engineering might become monotonous for others.</p>
<p>We usually discuss analytics for the remaining topics. Earlier this year, I gave a presentation on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-philippines/events/303153606/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">creating maps in R</a>. Looking ahead, the later sessions will likely focus more on analytics topics, including predictive analytics and a talk on unsupervised learning.</p>
<p><strong>Your group maintains a well-structured lineup of topics for the entire year. How do you plan and organize these meetups?</strong></p>
<p>We begin each year by discussing the topics we want our speakers to cover. Once we have a list, we search for speakers relevant to those subjects. My role typically involves handling administration and finding speakers for analytics-related topics like data science. We also have a team member specialising in software engineering and another who is focusing on AI. They are responsible for contacting their networks to find suitable speakers for our user group.</p>
<p>We maintain a calendar with topics that we plan to discuss throughout the year. However, we aren‚Äôt as meticulously organized as some other groups might be. We may have to change the topic if we struggle to find a speaker for a meeting. We aim to have a consistent lineup of subjects for our monthly meetups, totaling 12 topics for the year.</p>
<p>We believe it‚Äôs essential to be reliable and consistent for our members. Even if attendance is low‚Äîsay, just two or three people‚Äîwe still hold the meetup as promised. This reliability fosters trust within the community.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some key collaborators and supporters that help keep the R User Group Philippines running smoothly?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/data-engineering-scientific-applications-and-ai-inside-r-user-group-philippines-growth/RUG-PH-Organizers.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><em>Left to Right, Joma Mi√±oza, Joe Brillantes, Michelle Alarcon, and Rad Basa</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-alarcon-91477513/?originalSubdomain=ph">Michelle Alarcon</a> is still with us to provide support, although she has taken a more hands-off approach since she‚Äôs now managing the AI and Analytics Association of the Philippines. She remains a valuable resource, and I can often count on her assistance when needed.</p>
<p>We also utilize other connections. For instance, I often contact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jomaminoza/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=ph">Joma Mi√±oza</a>, who works at the Center for AI Research in the Philippines, when we need expertise on AI topics. Additionally, we have Rad Basa involved in our efforts.</p>
<p>Rad Basa is a software engineer who works for <a href="https://www.appsilon.com/">Appsilon</a>. When we discuss software engineering practices, I typically consult him. We are also good friends with <a href="https://dataengineering.ph/">Data Engineering Pilipinas</a>. The founder of that group, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ogbinar/?originalSubdomain=hk">Myk Ogbinar</a>, is very supportive and assists me when I need help finding speakers for events.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/data-engineering-scientific-applications-and-ai-inside-r-user-group-philippines-growth/MykOgbinar.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p><em>Myk Ogbinar</em></p>
<p>These are the key people I usually bounce ideas off when planning activities and selecting speakers. I ask for their perspectives regarding the needs of the R Users Group members. We also have many dedicated R users in academia. While we invite them to participate, we usually don‚Äôt involve them in planning since we understand they are swamped. However, if we have a specific topic in mind, we can reach out, and they often suggest that one of their professors speak on the subject.</p>
<p>Overall, many individuals contribute to the organization of the R Users Group in the Philippines, and their support is greatly appreciated.</p>

  <title>Strengthening R Communities Across Borders: Ozan Evkaya on Organizing the Edinburgh R User Group</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/strengthening-r-communities-across-borders-ozan-evkaya-on-organizing-the-edinburgh-r-user-group/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozanevkaya/">Ozan Evkaya</a>, one of the local organizers of the <a href="http://edinbr.org/">Edinburgh R User group</a>, recently spoke with the R Consortium about his journey in the R community and his efforts to strengthen R adoption in Edinburgh. He discussed his experiences hosting R events in Turkey during the pandemic, the importance of online engagement, and his vision for expanding collaborations with neighboring user groups. He also reflected on his research in dependence modeling and contributions to open-source R packages, highlighting how R continues to shape his work in academia and community building.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/strengthening-r-communities-across-borders-ozan-evkaya-on-organizing-the-edinburgh-r-user-group/Ozan_Evkaya.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>During my PhD program in statistics from 2012 to 2018, I took several courses in the field. I began engaging with programming languages relevant to my dissertation and applied work throughout that period. I started learning and using the R programming language, particularly after attending one academic workshop event in France.</p>
<p>Many of my colleagues, especially those from the statistics field, innovatively and effectively used these languages. This inspired me to invest more time in developing my skills in this area during my PhD studies. In addition to my postdoc research, I began participating in and organizing small online webinars during the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.</p>
<p>During that time, I met a couple of Turkish colleagues who were key in organizing some R-based events. It was my first experience with the official community-related groups associated with the R Consortium. With their support, we received a budget to help organize online events in Turkey during 2021 and 2022 called <a href="https://whyr.pl/2022/turkey/en/#:~:text=WhyR%20%3F,users%20from%20academia%20and%20industry.">Why R Turkiye</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, we started with simple online setups, but in 2022, we organized the event with paper submissions, an improved version of the previous year. The event was well-received, and everyone appreciated our efforts. In our first year, we had a group of six main organizers (including two undergraduate keen students from different universities). By 2022, our team had grown to eight members to foster gender diversity.</p>
<p>This experience taught me what can happen when people are passionate about organizing events online. It was also the first time I truly learned about the community and how others are working to expand their knowledge by sharing and collaborating.</p>
<p>When I joined the University of Edinburgh in March 2022, I began to explore the local R groups available in the area. I discovered the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/edinbr/">Edinburgh R user group (EdinbR)</a>, a local community, and promptly contacted the main organizer to express my interest in joining.</p>
<p>Since then, we have started organizing various local events. However, the group was not very active during 2022 because the lead organizer was busy with personal matters. Another colleague and I stepped in to revitalize the group.</p>
<p>Our organizing team currently consists of three members: myself, Alessia Calafiore (a colleague from the university), and the lead organizer, Mike Spencer, a PhD alumnus of the university who now works as a data scientist for a company based in Edinburgh. These shared connections help create a close-knit and collaborative community, especially since we use one of the university‚Äôs buildings for our activities. The team brings together one industry representative (Mike) and two university lecturers‚Äîmyself from the School of Mathematics, and Alessia, who lectures in Sustainability and Urban Data Science at the Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture. We benefit from excellent group dynamics and a strong foundation of familiarity.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the balance between industry and academia in the Edinburgh R community? Which industries are actively using R?</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, there is a balance between academics and industry in their use of programming languages. While Python is quite popular in specific fields, especially for certain packages tailored to research and data visualization, R is still preferred for many tasks.</p>
<p>Based on my interactions with members of the Edinburgh R Group and the<a href="https://rss.org.uk/">Royal Statistical Society</a>‚Äôs (RSS) local user groups, I see both industrial professionals and academics actively using R. For example, I can share the experience of one of our MSc students who recently started working at a company in the biostatistics field. They rely on R for data manipulation, and many similar examples are emerging here in Edinburgh.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/strengthening-r-communities-across-borders-ozan-evkaya-on-organizing-the-edinburgh-r-user-group/EdinburghRUG_Meetup.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Edinburgh R User Group Event: ‚Äú<a href="https://www.meetup.com/edinbr/events/306226785/?eventOrigin=group_events_list">No likelihood? No problem! ‚Äî Bayesian Statistics in R</a>‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the coming months? What topics do you want to cover?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently organizing monthly events based on feedback gathered from our audience. These events occur on Thursday evenings, allowing participants from academia and industry to join after traditional working hours.</p>
<p>We currently hold these events once a month, featuring two speakers in each session. We connect their topics meaningfully to create a cohesive experience for the audience. We aim to accommodate various levels of expertise, including beginner, intermediate, and advanced users of our language. Last month, we successfully organized a joint event with the RSS local group in Edinburgh. We may consider collaborating with other communities for similar joint events.</p>
<p>This platform allows us to share and spread ideas, potentially creating new event styles. One of my dreams is to organize a more significant event, something we haven‚Äôt had enough time to pursue yet. There are local groups nearby, such as the one in Glasgow, that could be involved. I hope to organize a significant event once a year, and while we haven‚Äôt discussed it much with those groups yet, I look forward to collaborating with them on this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Do you recommend any techniques for planning for or during the event? (Github, Zoom, other.) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who cannot attend physical events in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We primarily use the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/edinbr/">Meetup</a> group, which our main organizer, Mike, established several years ago. We are still active, and people are eager to join and register as local group members. Currently, we have 928 members, which is a significant number, I believe. Many of them are enthusiastic about attending our events, and it‚Äôs terrific to see so many familiar faces from various organizations at each gathering. The leading platforms we are currently using for the circulation of our events are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/EdinbR.fosstodon.org.ap.brid.gy">BlueSky</a> and LinkedIn personal pages.</p>
<p>We want to promote our events through existing channels where our natural audience and contacts are already engaged. This is a fitting space for our outreach. Additionally, our speakers sometimes share their slides on GitHub, mainly when using R to create their presentations. This allows them to easily share their slides and the GitHub repository, enabling everyone to contribute to the open-source community. Aside from the above-mentioned ones, we don‚Äôt have any specific technical tools currently in use.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use R for your work?</strong></p>
<p>I rely heavily on R and the various packages for research/teaching and am also trying to contribute to those packages. This dependency started during my PhD, when I focused on dependence modeling with certain available R-based computational packages. A talented group of people who created these open-source packages has already developed many techniques related to dependence modeling in R. While some packages are now available in Python more recently, I still primarily depend on R for these topics.</p>
<p>During my first postdoctoral period, working with colleagues at KU Leuven, I worked on two packages and integrated them for my research project. I‚Äôm currently polishing this work before creating a more formal package or sharing it on GitHub‚Äîthis is still one of my goals. In addition to my original research, I contributed to a Shiny-based research project initiated by a colleague at Boƒüazi√ßi University in 2021/2022 to create an R package version of their studies.</p>
<p>Overall, I want to explore various areas beyond my primary research. I‚Äôm also using R extensively for teaching purposes, particularly in the data science course I co-teach and the statistics and data visualization courses I run remotely. My reliance on R is significant for these courses, and I am regularly learning new tips or packages from the community that I have been part of.</p>

  <title>R in Maine: Connecting Ecologists, Medical Researchers, and Data Scientists</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-in-maine-connecting-ecologists-medical-researchers-and-data-scientists/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://szlo.ai/">Donald Szlosek</a>, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/maine-r-users-group/?eventOrigin=event_home_page">MaineR Users Group</a> organizer, recently spoke with the R Consortium about the group‚Äôs transition from a city-based meetup to a statewide community and its efforts to engage a diverse audience. Donald shared insights into organizing events, the challenges of hybrid formats, and the shift toward virtual workshops based on community feedback. He also highlighted his work in real-world evidence studies, where R is critical in causal inference and machine learning validation.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-in-maine-connecting-ecologists-medical-researchers-and-data-scientists/DonaldSzlosek.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p><em>Donald Szlosek presenting on exploring nature through {rvest}</em></p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Donald Szlosek, and I am a senior staff research biostatistician at <a href="https://www.idexx.com/en/">IDEXX</a> Laboratories. I got involved in the local R community when a small group in Portland, Maine, began its user group through <a href="https://www.mainehealth.org/maine-medical-center">Maine Medical Center</a>. I collaborated with one of the leads, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-black-7904a26b/">Adam Black</a>, who sought to unite the community. He aimed to involve various groups, not just those focused on research but also from other industries, as there wasn‚Äôt much available back in 2015.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, our activities slowed down for about a year and a half, but I‚Äôm pleased to say we are starting to regain momentum. Over the past couple of years, we have become more active again.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us what events you are currently hosting. Are they online, in-person, or hybrid? What kind of response do you receive for your events?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-in-maine-connecting-ecologists-medical-researchers-and-data-scientists/MaineRUGlogo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Last year, we primarily held online workshops, which proved immensely beneficial. One of our user group members, a fantastic professor, <a href="https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/">Dr.&nbsp;Laurie Baker</a>, received a community data science grant. She offered to run some workshops and asked if we could help promote them within our user group. We gladly agreed, and the workshops turned out to be fantastic. Her work was truly impressive, and we were thrilled to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Last year, we conducted a start-of-the-year survey to gather feedback from our community. We asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù and compiled the responses using Google Sheets. We were surprised to learn that people wanted more virtual events, mainly since we had primarily focused on in-person gatherings. Additionally, many requested workshops, which we had never offered before. As a result, we shifted our focus last year. While we didn‚Äôt hold as many events as I would have liked‚Äîorganizing them can be challenging‚Äîthe ones we did hold turned out well.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-in-maine-connecting-ecologists-medical-researchers-and-data-scientists/MaineRUGOrganizersPosit2023.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Left to right: Adam Black, Jaclyn Janis, Allison Hinton, and Donald Szlosek at the 2023 Posit Conference</p>
<p>However, the turnout at these events has been relatively small. We have a core group of about 12 people interested in attending, but typically, only two to three from that group show up at any event. Given this small number, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect large turnouts. This situation was one of the reasons we transitioned from the Portland R User Group to a statewide R User Group in hopes of attracting more participants.</p>
<p>That said, when you shift from focusing on a city to an entire state, reaching everyone becomes much more challenging unless you host virtual events. This realization significantly influenced our decision to adopt a virtual event format.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.meetup.com/maine-r-users-group/events/306012911/?eventOrigin=group_past_events">February 11th, we hosted a virtual kickoff event</a> to start the year. During this event, we asked our community what they wanted to see from us this year. Our goal was to gather feedback on their interests and preferences. This event was less formal than a workshop or presentation, but we hope it will set us on the right path to better serve our community. We also hope to have a workshop on creating publication-ready tables with {gt} in March.</p>
<p><strong>Please share a bit about your experience in organizing the group. Over the years, have you discovered any techniques or tools that have helped organize the group and the events you host?</strong></p>
<p>My biggest lesson is that hybrid events are challenging to manage alone. I‚Äôve essentially stopped organizing them unless I can get someone to assist me‚Äîeither with the online component or by handling the hosting while I take care of the online side. It‚Äôs just tough to juggle both aspects simultaneously.</p>
<p>Additionally, I try to maintain a positive mindset by reminding myself that I‚Äôll be excited even if just one person shows up. I aim to keep that energy level because these events often attract small groups, and people are busy. I want to be respectful and kind and genuinely appreciate having a single participant join.</p>

<p><strong>What industry are you currently in? How do you use R in your work?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôm in the pharmaceutical medical device industry and utilize various methods in three main areas of my job. First, I conduct typical clinical trials, which involve the design and analysis in partnership with forty different universities worldwide. This process requires extensive data analysis, preparation, and statistical methodology. We utilize R Markdown documents for this purpose, and I‚Äôve found them highly effective.</p>
<p>Another key focus of my work is real-world evidence studies, which have gained substantial traction over the past decade by leveraging large-scale electronic medical record data. In this area, we apply causal inference techniques to understand better the relationship between real-world clinical practice and medical data.</p>
<p>We engage in various activities, such as propensity score matching and targeted maximum likelihood estimation, which are fundamental to real-world evidence studies. This is a significant part of our work.</p>
<p>The last aspect we focus on is machine learning validation for regulatory bodies. We develop models that function as new medical devices, which need to be validated before they can be used in practice. While it‚Äôs great that a data science team has built a reliable model and performed internal validations, we must ensure it won‚Äôt negatively impact clinicians when they use it. Our goal is to prevent any additional concerns for them while they work.</p>
<p>Moreover, confirming that the model is effective within the specific population it is intended for is crucial. This is where the validation component plays a vital role. In this process, R programming is essential for matching datasets and pulling information from clinics‚Äô relevant data sources. This allows us to analyze the model‚Äôs accuracy from a statistical perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Which Industries do you see using R in Maine?</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, most of our events in Maine attendees come from the ecology field rather than the medical side. However, this might change as new medical facilities are in the area. Boston, being only a couple of hours away, has many medical-related resources.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gmri.org/">Gulf of Maine Research Institute</a> conducts significant work in marine biology, further emphasizing the focus on ecology, forest biology, and marine conservation among the people in our group. Seeing their perspective is refreshing since I come from a very different background.</p>
<p>Although our work might seem different on the surface, there‚Äôs a lot of common ground; for example, a statistician in one field is quite similar to a statistician in another. Learning about their data collection processes, such as collecting water samples, analyzing the data, and managing the information, is fascinating. Their approach to data gathering is quite distinct and presents different challenges. Hearing about their methods compared to ours is genuinely intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about the recent or current project you are working on using R.</strong></p>
<p>I am working on real-world evidence studies focusing on inverse propensity score weighting. These studies often involve imbalanced populations, requiring robust causal inference techniques to address disparities in treatment groups. By applying inverse propensity score weighting, I aim to balance treatment groups and covariates, enhancing comparability and making the analysis more comparable to a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>There is still considerable debate about whether techniques like inverse propensity score weighting offer more value than traditional multivariable regression. This remains an area of active discussion, and I am continuously working to deepen my understanding of the limitations of weighting. While propensity score methods help address confounding and improve balance in observational studies, their advantages over regression approaches depend on the specific context and assumptions of the analysis. My next step is to ensure that I am not overlooking any crucial aspects or limitations of these methodologies, especially considering their popularity based on my current understanding.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/l-p-cruz-phd/">Lito P. Cruz</a>, organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/melburn-melbourne-users-of-r-network/">Melbourne Users of R Network</a> (MELBURN), recently spoke with the R Consortium about the evolving R community in Melbourne and the group‚Äôs efforts to engage data professionals across government, academia, and industry. Lito shared insights into the group‚Äôs history, the impact of the pandemic on community engagement, and his ongoing efforts to revitalize in-person and hybrid events. He discussed new initiatives, including collaborations with the Statistical Society of Australia and interactive event formats featuring hands-on tutorials.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/revitalizing-the-melbourne-users-of-r-network-hybrid-events-collaboration-and-the-future-of-r/LitoPCruz.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve had a long career in IT here in Melbourne, Australia, where I worked as a contract software developer and engineer. I focused primarily on mathematics during my university years, including my graduate studies and doctoral work. I took several graduate courses in statistics before switching to computer science. In my postgraduate studies, I concentrated more on discrete mathematics.</p>
<p>Around 2013, I noticed a growing interest in statistics among executives and managers. Many were introduced to statistics during their MBA programs and were now eager to apply it in their roles. This shift prompted me to think about the increasing relevance of statistics in decision-making processes.</p>
<p>In 2012, I noticed an opportunity as more people began to engage with statistics. This was exciting because I have a passion for modeling and statistics-related work. I started learning R in 2013 and took several online courses, including <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rdpeng">Roger D. Peng</a>‚Äôs data science courses on Coursera. Through this, I learned more about R and its history, realizing that it originated from the S programming language inspired by functional languages like Lisp and <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a>. As a fan of functional programming, I appreciated that R supports this style.</p>
<p>As I delved deeper into R, I quickly fell in love with it. I believe it‚Äôs an excellent language, especially for data science work. I have successfully delivered many data pipelines in the industry using R and haven‚Äôt encountered any significant issues. My desire to gain more knowledge about the language only grew.</p>
<p>I particularly admire R‚Äôs functional style, which allows me to write concise code. This brevity makes debugging more manageable, and I‚Äôve experienced significant success with it. Given the choice, I will always opt for R.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share what the R community is like in Melbourne?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/revitalizing-the-melbourne-users-of-r-network-hybrid-events-collaboration-and-the-future-of-r/MELBURNlogo.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>R programming is prominent in various sectors, including government, healthcare, finance, insurance, banking, and academia.</p>
<p>Within the federal government, R is widely relied on. Many agencies use R as a substitute for SAS due to licensing costs; R is a cost-effective alternative.</p>
<p>R is also widely utilized in healthcare, especially in hospitals where numerous statisticians are engaged in biostatistics. This makes R a valuable tool in that sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, actuaries in the finance and insurance industries frequently use R, favoring it for its analytical capabilities.</p>
<p>In the banking sector, certain divisions still employ R. In Australia, banks operate as conglomerates with separate business units that often have the autonomy to choose their technical tools. If a specific application requires it, R might be selected based on the recommendations of technical experts.</p>
<p>Academia also remains loyal to R, although there is a current trend leaning toward Python for its ease of use. Students studying statistics, econometrics, actuarial sciences, or life sciences will likely be taught R as part of their coursework. Fields such as biology and economics frequently incorporate R in their curriculum. The continued support for R in educational programs ensures its relevance and viability as a programming option.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about the history of the Melbourne R User Group and how it has evolved over the years?</strong></p>
<p>The initial founder of an R User Group in 2010, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-dubossarsky-09208a1/?originalSubdomain=au">Dr.&nbsp;Eugene Dubossarsky</a>, was quite influential in the field of analytics, which, back then, was simply referred to as ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù before the term ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù became popular.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/revitalizing-the-melbourne-users-of-r-network-hybrid-events-collaboration-and-the-future-of-r/MELBURNMeetup.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Today, our database has grown to 2,900 members associated with the Melbourne R-Users group. I‚Äôve actually asked our members to remove their names if they‚Äôre no longer interested in R, as we want to clean up the list. However, I haven‚Äôt had much success; many still want to remain in the community.</p>
<p>Since late 2020, we have conducted our meetings in a hybrid format, allowing in-person attendance and Zoom participation. Our member base includes individuals from all over the world‚ÄîCanada, the US, the Middle East, and Africa‚Äîinterested in our activities.</p>
<p>Historically, before the pandemic, our meetings consistently drew between 70 and 120 attendees. However, when COVID-19 hit, it felt like throwing water on a fire; attendance dropped significantly as people became concerned about their health and the health of their loved ones.</p>
<p>I have been working on reviving the group since last year, and our first in-person meeting took place in September 2024. We‚Äôre gradually getting back on track, little by little.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about the recent activities of the Melbourne R User Group?</strong></p>
<p>We currently have the usual activities planned, and these are our current ideas. First, we always enjoy informal talks and fellowship at a restaurant, which allows us to network and build connections. We‚Äôre still trying to grow this group and have about a dozen regular attendees.</p>
<p>I want to make this group more interactive by reminding everyone that this is their user group and that we can shape its activities. I opened the floor for suggestions and asked what everyone would like to do this year. One idea was a barbecue, so we‚Äôll be planning that. The group enjoys fellowship, interaction, and the opportunity to make new friends with similar interests.</p>
<p>Additionally, we‚Äôve decided to split our talks into two segments. The main talk will last about 45 minutes, and we will introduce a new 15-minute tutorial segment. This segment will cover topics such as ‚ÄúHow R can do X,‚Äù where we can showcase various R capabilities, like interfacing with JavaScript or generating Shiny code using AI.</p>
<p>We are also collaborating with the Victoria branch of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/statistical-society-of-australia-victorian-branch/">Statistical Society of Australia</a>. They are interested in cross-pollinating with us, meaning they want to attend our meetings and invite us to theirs since many statisticians in that group use R.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/revitalizing-the-melbourne-users-of-r-network-hybrid-events-collaboration-and-the-future-of-r/MELBURNBBQ.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Another idea was to have a portion where someone could present how to utilize R for various tasks. R can be applied in many areas. I emphasized that the R Consortium webpage, run by Quattro, is powered by R. This is a fantastic showcase for R‚Äôs capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>What tools and techniques do you use to collaborate with other organizations and engage the community?</strong></p>
<p>In the past, I have observed how active members sometimes received support from companies that wanted to contribute positively to the R community and the industry.</p>
<p>In December 2024, a company sponsored one of our meetups by covering the venue costs. We are now looking to reopen this opportunity, as some companies have expressed interest in hosting our meetings at their corporate locations. We‚Äôre eager to facilitate this.</p>
<p>We utilize LinkedIn and Meetup to keep our community informed. I regularly communicate with attendees, sending them at least two messages before each event on the first Tuesday of every month.</p>
<p>Before each monthly event, I send a hello to our members as a reminder. I do this in hopes of getting them to return and participate. If you look at our pictures, you can see that historically, we have around 120 people attending our user group in Melbourne. We haven‚Äôt fully kick-started our relationship with the Statistical Society of Australia, Victoria branch. Still, I plan to improve our representation when we meet with them next month.</p>
<p>Coordinating with them can be challenging since their organizer is based in Sydney. However, I‚Äôve noticed that some of our members are also members of the Statistical Society. We will have more activities planned as the months progress.</p>

  <title>Exploring geometa: An R Package for Managing Geographic Metadata</title>
  <dc:creator>R Consortium</dc:creator>
  <link>https://r-consortium.org/posts/exploring-geometa-an-r-package-for-managing-geographic-metadata/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><strong>geometa</strong> provides an essential object-oriented data model in R, enabling users to efficiently manage geographic metadata. The package facilitates handling of ISO and OGC standard geographic metadata and their dissemination on the web, ensuring that spatial data and maps are available in an open, internationally recognized format. As a widely adopted tool within the geospatial community, geometa plays a crucial role in standardizing metadata workflows.</p>
<p>Since 2018, the <strong>R Consortium</strong> has supported the development of geometa, recognizing its value in bridging metadata standards with R‚Äôs data science ecosystem. You can try geometa yourself here: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=geometa">CRAN ‚Äì geometa</a>.</p>
<p>In this interview, we speak with <strong>Emmanuel Blondel</strong>, the author of geometa, ows4R, geosapi, geonapi and geoflow‚Äîkey R packages for geospatial data management. With a background in <strong>Agronomic Sciences and Environmental &amp; Natural Resources Management</strong> from the French National Polytechnical Institute (<strong>INP-ENSAT</strong>), Emmanuel specializes in <strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</strong> applied to fields such as agronomy, environment, fisheries, and aquatic sciences. As an active open-source developer, he shares insights into the evolution of geometa, the challenges of metadata standardization, and the future of geospatial data management in R.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-significance-of-geometa-including-support-for-iso-19115-3-getting-published-on-cran-is-this-about-incorporating-new-standards">What is the significance of geometa including support for ISO 19115-3 getting published on CRAN? Is this about incorporating new standards?</h2>
<p>Yes, it‚Äôs all about metadata standards. ISO standards can have a lifecycle from around five to ten years, and it takes time for institutions, governments, and software providers to adopt and implement them. The primary standard for geographic metadata has been ISO 19115 developed by the ISO/TC 211 (Technical Committee on Geographic Information/Geomatics). It defines the structure for describing geographic information. It is initially composed by the main geographic metadata standard (ISO 19115-1) and an extension to describe gridded and imagery datasets, called ISO 19115-2. To facilitate XML encoding, ISO 19139 provides the corresponding XML schema for implementing ISO 19115-compliant metadata.</p>
<p>ISO 19115 has been widely used in geographic information systems, software providers, and legal frameworks such as the INSPIRE directive in Europe or the Geospatial Data Act in the U.S.. Countries and international organizations have gradually adopted ISO 19115. Meanwhile a new version of the ISO 19115, called ISO 19115-3, was developed by ISO experts to refactor and consolidate the standard. However, adoption takes time.</p>

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been pushing for this update. Since standardization work is a continuous process, there are already other prospects for improvements, such as the management of the JSON encoding format, targeted by the next ISO 19115-4 standard under development.</h2>

<p>ISO 19115 and related standards, such as GML (Geographic Markup Language), are built on large object-oriented information models. It made sense to use an object-oriented data model in R to align with these standards.</p>
<p>I chose <strong>R6</strong> because it was the most convenient and practical way to model objects. I had previously explored other approaches, but R6 offered flexibility and efficiency.</p>
<p>Now, I‚Äôm also keeping an eye on <strong>S7</strong>, an initiative from the R Consortium. In the future, I might explore new approaches for object modeling such as S7, and possibly adopt them in packages such as geometa.</p>

What are its main advantages?</h2>
<p>R‚Äôs main advantage is its broad accessibility across various roles‚Äîdata managers, scientists, statisticians‚Äîwho all understand and use it.</p>
<p>This was a key reason why I developed <strong>geometa</strong> in R. In the past, I worked with Java for similar projects, but my colleagues struggled with it because they weren‚Äôt Java developers, and the programming language was a barrier. R served as a common language among them, enabling better collaboration.</p>
<p>There are two main challenges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The technology constraint</strong> (R itself).</li>
<li><strong>The complexity of metadata standards</strong>, which are exhaustive and highly specialized.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>geometa</strong> provides fine-grained control, fully aligning with the standards. However, I‚Äôve also developed tools to simplify metadata creation, making it easier for non-developers to generate metadata efficiently.</p>

What‚Äôs the best way to get started?</h2>
<p>All these packages are open-source and available on GitHub. The best way to start is by checking the documentation and vignettes‚Äî<strong>ows4R</strong>, for example, has detailed vignettes.</p>
<p>On GitHub, I‚Äôve also enabled the <strong>Discussions</strong> panel, which acts as a forum where users can ask questions. I make an effort to answer questions in my spare time, and the discussions often help improve documentation and package functionality.</p>
<p>Some key differences between the packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ows4R">ows4R</a></strong> standards for OGC Web-Services for R and includes tools to interact with these services including metadata services (Catalogue Service for the Web - CSW) but also data services (with the well-known Web Feature Service - WFS and Web Coverage Service - WCS). With this package, metadata produced with geometa can be published within standard metadata catalogues, and metadata fetched from there. Users interested in using standard protocols instead of software-specific APIs may prefer this package.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=geonapi">Geonapi</a></strong> is API-specific. It provides tools to manage metadata but with the <a href="https://geonetwork-opensource.org/">Geonetwork</a> API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/r-geoflow/geoflow">Geoflow</a></strong> serves as an orchestrator, integrating metadata, data, and tasks to publish them into web catalogs, including non-geographic ones.</li>

<p>My experience with the R Consortium has been positive. My <a href="https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/2018-group-2.html#strengthening-of-r-in-support-of-spatial-data-infrastructures-management-geometa-and-ows4r-r-packages">first project</a> on geometa was funded in 2018, and it was a significant boost for the package.</p>
<p>Since then, I had submitted another project twice, for enhancing the ows4R package, though it was not selected because maybe considered too specific. The R Consortium deals with a broad range of domains covered by the R community, so they have to prioritize. However, the interaction with them has always been great‚Äîboth administratively and with the <strong>Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC)</strong>.</p>
<p>Before submitting my first application, I reached out to the ISC for advice on proposal structuring, approval processes, and whether partial funding was an option. Their feedback was helpful, and I‚Äôd definitely recommend other developers consider applying. It‚Äôs a great opportunity for funding and support.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-kabir-garba-46795823/?originalSubdomain=ng">Dr.&nbsp;M.K. Garba</a> and <a href="https://gbganalyst.github.io/">Ezekiel Ogundepo</a>, organizers of the University of Ilorin, shortened to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/unilorin-r-user-group/">Unilorin R User Group</a>, recently spoke with the R Consortium about their efforts to promote R programming in Nigeria and foster a thriving local R community. They discussed the group‚Äôs origins, their experiences teaching R across academia and industry, and the impact of their inaugural event. Dr.&nbsp;Garba and Ezekiel also shared their plans for future workshops and highlighted their outreach strategies to engage learners and expand R‚Äôs reach in Nigeria. Ilorin is the capital city of Kwara State and is located in the western region of Nigeria.</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/promoting-r-in-nigeria-how-unilorin-r-user-group-is-making-an-impact/MKGarba.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;M. K. Garba</p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/promoting-r-in-nigeria-how-unilorin-r-user-group-is-making-an-impact/EzekielOgundepo.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:40.0%"></p>
<p>Ezekiel Ogundepo</p>
<p><strong>Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: I am Dr.&nbsp;M.K. Garba, a lecturer in the Department of Statistics at the <a href="https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/">University of Ilorin</a>. I organize the University of Ilorin R User Group, and my co-organizer and fellow instructor is Ezekiel.</p>
<p>I was introduced to R programming by a senior colleague in my department around 2011 or 2012, and I have been using R personally since then. During my PhD, I utilized R programming continuously from start to finish. In 2015 or 2016, I taught R programming as a course to a group of senior-level students just a year before graduation. I continued teaching it for several years before the course was handed over to another instructor.</p>
<p>Although I am no longer assigned as the lecturer for this course, I am motivated to share my knowledge and experiences with students. This desire led to the establishment of the R User Group. The group is not just for students in the Statistics department; it welcomes participants from other departments as long as they are interested in learning R programming.</p>
<p>Ezekiel: I am a statistician consultant with Data Science Nigeria. Additionally, I help Dr.&nbsp;Garba in teaching R programming. Dr.&nbsp;Garba was my lecturer at the University of Ilorin, where he served as my co-supervisor during my training. He introduced me to R programming in 2014, and we focused on statistical computing using this language. Since then, I have been using R programming across various industries.</p>
<p>In 2018, I became a <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/ogundepo+ezekiel_adebayo/">Tidyverse instructor</a> for R Studio and developed several R packages, including <a href="https://gbganalyst.github.io/bulkreadr/">bulkreadr</a> and <a href="https://gbganalyst.github.io/forstringr/">forstringr</a> packages. I am also a member of <a href="https://ropensci.org/champions/">R Champion</a>, an organization dedicated to promoting R programming in Nigeria and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>What is the local R community like in Nigeria? Is R being used in Academia and Industry?</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://r-consortium.org/posts/promoting-r-in-nigeria-how-unilorin-r-user-group-is-making-an-impact/UnilorinRUGlogo.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: I‚Äôll focus on academia and leave the industry to Ezekiel. While I am a tenured staff member at the University of Ilorin, I also serve as a visiting professor at several universities in my state. In any course I teach, I introduce my students to R programming. I am pleased to share that one or two of these institutions have adopted R as the programming language for their statistical computing courses.</p>
<p>Every university typically offers at least one statistical computing course, and many institutions have embraced R. Some may not use R exclusively; instead, they combine it with other software like <a href="https://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>, <a href="https://vsni.co.uk/software/genstat/">GenSTAT</a>, or <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html">SAS</a>. However, due to my introduction of R, it has gained traction in their programs. While some students hesitated to abandon their previous software, they embraced using R easily.</p>
<p>Ezekiel: We actively promote R programming across various industries in Nigeria. For example, we implement R programming solutions at <a href="https://datasciencenigeria.org/">Data Science Nigeria</a>, where I work as a consultant. Two months ago, we organized a boot camp that invited numerous instructors and trainers to teach attendees about programming languages such as Python, R, data science, machine learning, and AI. I had the opportunity to teach R to those participants. Additionally, we collaborate with several biotechnology companies in Nigeria, both in industry and academia.</p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about the first event from your R User Group. What topics were covered, and what kind of response did you receive for the event?</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: The first meetup took place after a two-week delay primarily because our targeted audience, the students at the University of Ilorin, were on break. Once they returned, we allowed them to settle in a few weeks before organizing our meeting. It was held virtually, and we were pleased with both the attendance and the feedback we received.</p>
<p>I was thrilled with the responses, especially since the participants were selected from various departments, not just those related to statistics or mathematics. We began the session with the basics, and those with intermediate knowledge could also learn and engage with the material effectively.</p>
<p>Ezekiel served as the instructor for this first meetup. We have a calendar in place and assigned roles for upcoming sessions. I invited him to share insights about what we taught during the meeting, which mainly focused on introductory concepts.</p>
<p>Ezekiel: We introduced the participants to an introductory level of programming, teaching them how to install the software and use the essential components of the R programming language. We covered various concepts, including data types and structures, to prepare them for more advanced topics in future meetings. While there were some issues due to the large number of attendees, everyone enjoyed the event.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the group in the coming year? How many events are you hoping to host, and what topics do you plan to cover?</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: Based on our schedule, I want to cover numerous topics, and I plan to invite many instructors, both national and international. We will discuss reproducibility in research, specifically using RStudio Project and version control for this purpose. Additionally, we want to focus on data visualization using the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> package.</p>
<p>We have a range of interesting topics on data analysis, various tidyverse libraries, and different aspects of geostatistics. These subjects will be valuable for participants from both academia and industry. R programming applications extend to areas of statistics, including econometrics, which are included in our calendar. Additionally, we will have a session on building a personal portfolio using Quarto.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to host your events in person or online?</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: We will have in-person sessions. As I mentioned, our primary focus is the students who were just getting settled then. That is why we initially opted for online sessions. However, there is no way we won‚Äôt conduct in-person classes, especially when it comes to practical demonstrations of what we are teaching. The students need to showcase their learning in person.</p>
<p><strong>What tools and techniques do you plan to use to promote your events?</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garba: We use the Meetup platform where students can register to participate in discussions about our training sessions. When participants have questions, they can raise them, and we respond accordingly. We also encourage other participants to answer questions if they have the expertise; if no one else can answer, we step in. This platform is where we share information about our meetup schedules.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have individual Twitter handles and LinkedIn profiles that we use to disseminate information. On the day of our training sessions, we stream the events live on Facebook. Although we also have a YouTube account, we encountered an issue and could not stream on that platform that day. However, the event was successfully streamed live on Facebook.</p>
<p>We promoted the initiative using hashtags like #rstats #DataScience #LearnR, which we knew would help retrieve any other relevant information related to R. We contacted the entire R ecosystem, including groups like<a href="https://ropensci.org/">R OpenSci</a>and other organizations. In Nigeria, we have numerous R user groups and we shared our message with them. They were also instrumental in helping us promote it. Overall, this strategy worked perfectly.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pilot-5">Pilot 5</h3>
<p>Last year the <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">submission working group</a> was able to successfully deliver its third R-based submission to the FDA through the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/electronic-regulatory-submission-and-review/electronic-common-technical-document-ectd">eCTD portal</a> on September 20, 2024. We are excited to share news the Pilot 5 launch as we continue to demonstrate R‚Äôs capablities to deliver a high-quality drug submission.</p>
<p>A quick recap of previous Pilots:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/12/08/successful-r-based-test-package-submitted-to-fda">Pilot 1</a> delivered Tables and Figures to the FDA using R.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2022/12/07/update-successful-r-based-package-submission-with-shiny-component-to-fda">Pilot 2</a> delivered the same Tables and Figures using a Shiny App using R. <a href="https://archive.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/10/05/shiny-app-successfully-reviewed-by-fda-cder-staff-pilot-2-announcement-2">Pilot 2 Announcement 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://r-consortium.org/posts/news-from-r-submissions-working-group-pilot-3/">Pilot 3</a> delivered the Tables and Figures using R as well as the ADaMs‚Ä¶you guessed it using R.</li>
<li><a href="https://r-consortium.org/posts/using-r-to-submit-research-to-the-fda-pilot-4-successfully-submitted/">Pilot 4</a> is in the process of delivering the Shiny App from Pilot 2 using webassembly and containers (almost completed!).</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on these Pilots navigate to our <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/pilot_background.html">Pilot‚Äôs background page on submission working group</a></p>
<p>Now in 2025, we are launching Pilot 5!! We will be using R again, but instead of delivering all the datasets as <code>xpt</code> files we will make use of the new <code>datasetjson</code> format via the eponymously named R package <a href="https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson/">datasetjson</a> and hope to deliver two submissions for 2025 split into Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot 5 - Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Part 1 is going to replicate <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot3-adam">Pilot 3</a>. We will reuse the ADaMs, Tables and Figure programs that were written in R. However, the Pilot 3 ADaMs were written out as <code>xpt</code> files and we will instead use <code>datasetjson</code>! Hence Pilot 5 is really focused on using the new transport file type <code>datasetjson</code>.</p>
<p>Pilot 5 Part 1 will also submit all the other files you find in the Pilot 3 submission as part of our package. If you have a passion for submission work, R and <code>datasetjson</code> or just want to see what all the fuss is about then come and <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/rconsortium/shared_invite/zt-2w4t2jd38-Z7BYYse9tIlCZEmqHvHnbA">join us</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Pilot 5 - Part 2</strong></p>
<p>The Pilots are small! 5 ADaMs, 3 Tables and 1 Figure is not a typical submission package for a drug that can impact a patient‚Äôs health and well-being! The Pilots have always been about testing out and advocating that R can keep up with the best of the best. For Part 2, we want to build up this body of work and develop several more ADaMs and more Tables and Figures. As in Part 1, we will deliver everything using <code>datasetjson</code> that would of been delivered as an <code>xpt</code> file.</p>
<p>We plan on kicking Part 2 off mid-summer, but planning will probably start soon! Come <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/rconsortium/shared_invite/zt-2w4t2jd38-Z7BYYse9tIlCZEmqHvHnbA">join</a> in on the fun and help us build a larger body of work around drug submissions using R.</p>

<section id="progress-reports-and-future-plans" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="progress-reports-and-future-plans">Progress Reports and Future Plans</h2>
<p><strong>Updates on Pilot 4</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the R Consortium R submission <em>Pilot 4 </em>Project is to explore the use of novel technologies such as Linux containers and WebAssembly to bundle a Shiny application into a self-contained package, facilitating a smoother process of both transferring and executing the application. The application was built using the source data sets and analyses contained in the R submission <em>Pilot 1-3</em>. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available submission package that includes a WebAssembly component. We hope this submission package and what we have learned can serve as a good reference for future regulatory submission efforts. The WebAssembly technology compiles applications into a portable, consistent environment driven by a web browser, allowing agency reviewers to easily run and evaluate software without complex setups. The second half of the Pilot 4 Project (leveraging container technology to package a Shiny application) will be submitted as an additional package later this year. Additional agency feedback will be shared in future communications.</p>
<p>The R Consortium is excited to announce that, on September 20, 2024, the R Submissions Working Group successfully submitted its test submission package‚Äîfeaturing a WebAssembly component‚Äîthrough the FDA‚Äôs Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) gateway! This marks a significant milestone as the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) staff has officially received the submission package.</p>
<p>Statistician Eric Nantz at pharmaceuticals company Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, says that using WebAssembly ‚Äúwill minimize, from the reviewer‚Äôs perspective, many of the steps that they had to take to get the application running on their machines.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Potential Pilot 6</strong></p>
<p>The Pilots have been making use of the original CDISC Pilot data from around 2008-2010 that were used as PoC for the FDA for CDISC standards. This data has been reused for many other projects across the industry as there is a severe lack of publicly available CDISC data. You can read about my quest to find some more data <a href="https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2025-02-17_data__packages/data__packages.html">here</a>. The submissions working group would like to create new simulated data from raw, SDTM and ADaMs that could be used to test new techniques, ways of working, etc all brought up to modern standards. If interested get in touch!</p>
<p><strong>A Re-Envisioned ADRG</strong></p>
<p>The Analysis Data Reviewer‚Äôs Guide (ADRG) has been focused on the proprietary language SAS for delivering submissions over many years. As open-source languages such as R are accepted as valid mechanisms to deliver a submission the ADRG needs to ‚Äúre-envisioned‚Äù to accommodate these languages. The pilots have had questions on how to document certain technical aspects in the ADRG of the R-based submission package, e.g.&nbsp;packages used and versions, R versions and layouts of the file folders.</p>
<p>Well we are in luck. Former Pilot members are working with the PHUSE Version Metadata for Open-Source Languages to support ADRG enhancements for open-source submissions and are sharing their recommendations to the Pilots. You can find out more at the below links:</p>

<p><strong>More about the R Submissions Working Group</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/">R Consortium R Submissions Working Group</a> is focused on improving practices for R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>Health authority agencies from different countries require electronic submission of data, computer programs, and relevant documentation to bring an experimental clinical product to market. In the past, submissions have mainly been based on the SAS language.</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry and research institutions. Although the health authorities accept submissions based on open source programming languages, sponsors may be hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a lack of working examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims to provide R-based submission examples and identify potential gaps while submitting these example packages. All materials, including submission examples and communications, are publicly available on the <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium">R consortium GitHub page.</a></p>
<p><strong>Join the R Submissions Working Group</strong></p>
<p>The R Submissions Working Group comprises members from over 10 pharmaceutical companies, as well as regulatory agencies. We are a collaborative community open to anyone interested in contributing to this important work.
