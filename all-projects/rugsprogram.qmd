# 2025 RUGs Program

The RUGs mission is to facilitate the person-to-person exchange of knowledge in small group settings on a global scale. We continue to believe that the most effective way for people to learn from and about each other, and to set and accomplish common goals is to meet face-to-face on a regular basis. Nevertheless, occasional virtual meetings are acceptable. 

RUGs grants are intended to help people form enduring R user group communities. Active user groups may apply for grants once every calendar year. 


These grants do not include support for software development or technical projects. Grants to support the R ecosystemâ€™s technical infrastructure are awarded and administered through the [ISC Grant Program](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals), which issues a call for proposals two times each year.

### Structure

R user groups grants under the RUGs 2025 program come in two parts:



1. R user groups that are not already participating in the RUGs meetup.com Pro account will be enrolled into this program. The R Consortium will pay the groupâ€™s meetup.com fees for twelve months after acceptance into the program. Thereafter, the R Consortium will continue to pay meetup.com dues for participating groups as long as the groups comply with the requirements above, remain active, continue to meet at least once every three months, and use meetup.com to schedule and announce meetings. User group organizers do not need to re-apply for meetup.com Pro account participation if the groupâ€™s meetup.com account remains active.
2. Cash grants typically vary between $500 and $1,250 and depend on group size and special needs.
