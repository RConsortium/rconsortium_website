# Embracing Inclusivity in R: The Journey of rainbowR

In the ever-evolving world of data science and statistical computing, R has become a beloved language, not just for its robustness and versatility, but also for its vibrant and inclusive community. A shining example of this inclusivity is rainbowR, a community dedicated to connecting, supporting, and promoting LGBTQ+ individuals who code in R. Founded by Ella Kaye of the University of Warwick, rainbowR has transformed into a thriving hub for LGBTQ+ coders and allies alike, fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie through innovative initiatives and data-driven activism.

## Origin and Growth of rainbowR

The inception of rainbowR dates back to the useR! Conference in 2017, when Ella Kaye engaged in a conversation that highlighted the need for a dedicated LGBTQ+ space within the R community. Fast forward to today, and rainbowR has grown exponentially, boasting a membership of over 100 individuals. This growth is not just a testament to the need for such a community but also to the welcoming atmosphere and the meaningful connections it fosters.

## Monthly Meetups and Buddy Scheme

Central to rainbowR's mission are its monthly online meetups, typically held on the fourth Wednesday of each month. These gatherings provide a relaxed and supportive environment where participants can discuss R-related topics, share resources, and showcase their work. The focus on creating a friendly space encourages open dialogue and fosters learning among members.

Another key initiative is the buddy scheme, which aims to facilitate deeper connections within the community. Every three months, members can opt into the scheme, where they are randomly paired with another member. An R script processes these pairings and generates personalized emails to introduce the paired individuals. This innovative approach not only eases the anxiety of meeting new people but also enriches the community fabric by fostering one-on-one connections.

## Data-Driven Activism

rainbowR's commitment to raising awareness about LGBTQ+ issues is further exemplified through its GitHub repository, Tidy Rainbow. This repository hosts a collection of LGBTQ+ datasets, providing valuable resources for data visualization and analysis. These datasets can be utilized for educational purposes, blog posts, or simply to practice data skills, making them a valuable asset for both community members and allies.

## Engaging with Literature: The Rainbow R Book Club

In addition to its technical initiatives, rainbowR has ventured into the literary world with its book club. The club recently completed its first session, where participants delved into "Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex, and Sexuality Data for Action" by Kevin Gian. The success of this book club highlights the community's commitment to broadening its understanding of LGBTQ+ issues through various mediums. Future book club sessions are in the pipeline, promising more engaging discussions and insights.

## Future Plans and the Role of Allies

As rainbowR looks to the future, exciting plans are underway to ensure the community's sustainability and impact. Ella Kaye, now a fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, is utilizing her fellowship to nurture and solidify rainbowR's foundations. This includes establishing clear engagement pathways, developing governance policies, and potentially becoming a legal entity.

A flagship event in the pipeline is the inaugural Rainbow R Conference, designed to bring the community together to share knowledge and celebrate diversity. Allies play a crucial role in this journey, and their involvement is highly valued within rainbowR. The conference organizing committee welcomes allies, further emphasizing the inclusive nature of this vibrant community.

## Call for Collaboration and Community Building

rainbowR's mission extends beyond its own community. By sharing knowledge and experiences with other R or queer communities, rainbowR aims to build a network of support and shared learning. Community managers interested in exploring best practices for community building are encouraged to reach out to Ella Kaye and explore potential collaborations.

## Join the Movement

For those interested in joining this vibrant community, rainbowR offers an open invitation to LGBTQ+ individuals and allies. By visiting [rainbow.org](https://rainbow.org), you can learn more about the community, sign up for newsletters, and become part of a supportive network that celebrates diversity and inclusivity in the R ecosystem.

rainbowR is more than just a community; it's a movement towards a more inclusive and supportive future for all who code in R. As the community continues to grow and evolve, it stands as a testament to the power of connection and the impact of collective action in the world of data science.
