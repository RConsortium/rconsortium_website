## Topological data analysis in R

Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing field that uses techniques
from algebraic topology to analyze the shape and structure of data. At its core,
TDA provides tools to understand the geometric and topological features of
datasets across multiple scales, with persistent homology (PH) being one of its
fundamental techniques.

Several R packages have emerged to provide TDA capabilities to the R community,
including:

-   [{TDA}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TDA) which focuses on statistical
analysis of PH and density clustering by providing an R interface for the
efficient algorithms of the C++ libraries
[GUDHI](https://project.inria.fr/gudhi/software/),
[Dionysus](https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/) and
[PHAT](https://bitbucket.org/phat-code/phat/). This package also implements
methods from @fasy2014confidence and @chazal2014stochastic for analyzing the
statistical significance of PH features.
-   [{TDAstats}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TDAstats) which provides a
comprehensive toolset for conducting TDA, specifically via the calculation of PH
in a Vietoris-Rips complex [@wadhwa2018tdastats].
-   [{ripserr}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ripserr) which provides an R
interface to the [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) and [Cubical Ripser](https://github.com/CubicalRipser) C++ libraries [@bauer2021ripser; @kaji2020cubical].
-   [{TDAkit}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TDAkit) which provides a
variety of algorithms to learn with PH of the data based on functional summaries
for clustering, hypothesis testing, and visualization
[@wasserman2018topological].
-   Other packages that have been archived due to lack of maintenance (e.g.
[{kernelTDA}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kernelTDA)).

While these packages have made TDA more accessible, they've also introduced
different data structures for representing persistence data, creating challenges
for interoperability and workflow consistency. Moreover, workflows using tools
from different packages will rely on some of the same low-level operations, like
computing PH and calculating distances between persistence diagrams. When each
package is built for purpose, this will lead to either duplication or cascading
dependencies.

The [{phutil}](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/) package addresses such
fragmentation by providing a unified toolbox for handling persistence data. It
offers consistent data structures and methods that work seamlessly with outputs
from various TDA packages. As part of the
[TDAverse](https://github.com/tdaverse) initiative, {phutil} contributes to
creating a coherent ecosystem for topological data analysis in R.

## Minimal mathematical background

### Persistent homology

The {phutil}
[documentation](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/articles/validation-benchmark.html#definitions)
provides an overview of persistent homology. For now, know that the result of
this procedure is a **persistence diagram**: a multiset (set with multiplicity)
of points in the plane---usually the upper-half plane and most often the first
quadrant. Persistence diagrams encode topological features of different
dimensions, and a single diagram may encode features of one or all dimensions.
By **persistence data**, we mean a data structure that encodes diagrams of all
dimensions, and possibly many diagrams coming from data sets of a common type.

### Distances between persistence diagrams

Two persistence diagrams $X$ and $Y$ are canonically compared using
**Wasserstein distances**.
These are a family of metrics determined by a $q$-Minkowski distance on the plane
and a $p$-norm on the distances between pairs of points matched via some $\varphi : X \to Y$:

$$ \left( \sum_{x \in X}{{\lVert
x-\varphi(x) \rVert_q}^p} \right)^{1/p} $$

The distance $W_p^q(X,Y)$ is defined to be the infimum of this expression over all possible matchings.
See the
[vignette](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/articles/validation-benchmark.html)
on distances for more detail, or @cohen2010lipschitz and @bubenik2023exact for
detailed treatments and stability results on these families of metrics.

## Implementations in {phutil}

The {phutil} package aims at serving as a low-level package that defines a
unifying toolbox for handling persistence data. This section describes the
class that has been implemented to handle a single persistence diagram as
well as the distances between persistence diagrams. The package also provides
a class of persistence data that can be used to store multiple diagrams, which
is simply a list of persistence diagrams. This class is not described here, but
will be the backbone of the forthcoming {inphr} package for making inference on
persistence diagrams.

### The [`persistence`](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/reference/persistence.html) class

The 'persistence' class is a list with the following components:

-   `pairs`: A list of 2-column matrices containing birth-death pairs. The
$i$-*th* element of the list corresponds to the $(i-1)$-*th* homology dimension.
If there is no pairs for a given dimension but there are pairs in higher
dimensions, the corresponding element(s) is/are filled with a $0 \times 2$
numeric matrix.

-   `metadata`: A list of length 6 containing information about how the data was
computed:

    -   `orderered_pairs`: A boolean indicating whether the pairs in the `pairs`
    list are ordered (i.e. the first column is strictly less than the second
    column).
    -   `data`: The name of the object containing the original data on which the
    persistence data was computed.
    -   `engine`: The name of the package and the function of this package that
    computed the persistence data in the form `"package_name::package_function"`.
    -   `filtration`: The filtration used in the computation in a human-readable
    format (i.e. full names, capitals where need, etc.).
    -   `parameters`: A list of parameters used in the computation.
    -   `call`: The exact call that generated the persistence data.

Currently, the following `S3` methods for objects of class `persistence` have
been implemented:

-   coercers from matrix, data.frame, objects of class 'diagram' as produced by
`TDA::*Diag()` functions, objects of class 'PHom' as produced by
`ripserr::vietoris_rips()` and objects of class
'hclust' as produced by `stats::hclust()`;
-   `format()` and `print()` which use the MIT-licensed
[{cli}](https://cli.r-lib.org) package behind the scene for printing out to the
console a nice colourful but brief summary of the persistence data;
-   `get_pairs()` to extract homological features from a specific dimension;
-   reverse coercers to go back to either matrix or data.frame representations.

Some more details about how these coercers work can be found in the dedicated
[vignette](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/articles/persistence-class.html) on
the website of the package.

For instance, one can start by some simulated point cloud using the
[{tdaunif}](https://tdaverse.github.io/tdaunif/) package:

```{r}
point_data <- tdaunif::sample_ellipse(n = 100L, ar = 2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-point-data
#| fig-cap: "A sample of 100 points drawn uniformly on the contour of an ellispe."
#| fig-align: center
plot(point_data, asp = 1)
```

A typical workflow would be to compute the persistence data from the point cloud
shown in @fig-point-data using the
[{TDA}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDA/index.html) package:

```{r}
ph_data <- TDA::ripsDiag(
    point_data,
    maxdimension = 1L,
    maxscale = 1.5
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-ph-data
#| fig-cap: "Persistence data computed from the point cloud shown in @fig-point-data."
#| fig-align: center
plot(ph_data$diagram, asp = 1)
```

The output that is displayed in @fig-ph-data is a list with a component
`diagram` that contains the persistence data in the form of an aobject of class
'diagram'. The latter is a 3-column matrix with the first column containing the
dimension of the homological feature, the second column containing the birth
time and the third column containing the death time. The column names

```{r}
colnames(ph_data$diagram)
```

mix lower and upper cases. Finally the object also has attributes:

```{r}
names(attributes(ph_data$diagram))
```

that store information about how the diagram has been computed. The
`persistence` class can coerce the 'diagram' object into a 'persistence' object:

```{r}
library(phutil)
ph_data_pers <- as_persistence(ph_data$diagram)
ph_data_pers
```

### Distance computations using [Hera](https://github.com/anigmetov/hera)

The {phutil} package inlcudes functions to compute bottleneck and Wasserstein
distances either between two persistence diagrams or in a pairwise fashion from
a set of persistence diagrams. The underlying computation is actually performed
via the BSD-licensed [*Hera*](https://github.com/anigmetov/hera) C++ library.
The latter library is bundled within {phutil} which required a `LinkingTo`
dependency on [{BH}](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/bh.html) for providing
access to the [*Boost*](https://www.boost.org) headers for Hera compilation. To
this end, the required Boost licensing terms have been copied over with the MIT
license terms which {phutil} depends on. Specifically, the following functions
are available:

-   `bottleneck_distance()` and `wasserstein_distance()` compute the eponymous
distance between two diagrams;
-   `bottleneck_pairwise_distances()` and `wasserstein_pairwise_distances()`
compute pairwise distances among a sample of persistence diagrams; these
functions have their C++ code parallelized via [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org);
to that end, they gain an optional `ncores` argument which is `1L` by default.

For example, {phutil} has a built-in set of 100 persistence diagrams computed on
100 noisy versions of points on the 2-sphere. The diagrams are stored in the
object
[`persistence_sample`](https://tdaverse.github.io/phutil/reference/persistence_sample.html).
The following code computes the pairwise bottleneck distances between the first
7 diagrams in the set:

```{r}
bottleneck_pairwise_distances(
    persistence_sample[1L:7L],
    ncores = 2L
)
```

## A stable, modular, extensible package collection

We are part of a loose-knit team of R developers interested in fostering a more
sustainable and convenient package collection for TDA, which we've come to call
the [TDAverse](https://github.com/tdaverse). The collection ranges from
low-level, general-purpose packages like {tdaunif} and now {phutil}, through
purpose-fit but interoperable packages like {ripserr} and {plt}, to Tidyverse
extensions like {ggtda} and the forthcoming {tdarec}.

Development of {phutil} was directly funded by an Infrastructure Steering
Committee grant from the R Consortium, together with several other packages that
will be presented in upcoming blog posts. While we hope to secure funding for
other specific projects in future, we also invite interested developers or users
to reach out with their issues or ideas.
