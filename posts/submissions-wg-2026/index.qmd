**More about the R Submissions Working Group**

The [R Consortium R Submissions Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/) is focused on improving practices for R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.

Health authority agencies from different countries require electronic submission of data, computer programs, and relevant documentation to bring an experimental clinical product to market. In the past, submissions have mainly been based on the SAS language. 

In recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical 
industry and research institutions. Although the health authorities accept submissions based on open source programming 
languages, sponsors may be hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a lack of working examples.

Therefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims to provide R-based submission examples and identify potential gaps 
while submitting these example packages. All materials, including submission examples and communications, are 
publicly available on the [R consortium GitHub page.](https://github.com/RConsortium)
