## Introduction

2025 was a very busy year for the Submissions Working Group and we have
big plans for 2026.

For 2025 recap we have two Pilots nearing completion:

- [Pilot 4](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/pilot4.html) - containers and webassembly
- [Pilot 5](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot5-website/) - datasetjson replacing all xpts

For 2026 we have launched two new Pilots:

- Pilot 6 - expansion of ADaMs and Display programs
- Pilot 7 - creation of new simulated data

Read on if you want to learn more about what we submitted to the FDA for 2025 and
what we plan on working on for 2026.

## Previous Pilots to the FDA

Each Pilot has served to explore how a sponsor can submit an R-based submission 
package to the FDA via the eCTD portal. The Pilots are small sets of programs
using the original [CDISC Pilot data](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project). 

Previous successful Pilots to the FDA:

-   [Pilot
    1](https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/12/08/successful-r-based-test-package-submitted-to-fda)
    delivered Tables and Figures to the FDA using R.
-   [Pilot
    2](https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2022/12/07/update-successful-r-based-package-submission-with-shiny-component-to-fda)
    delivered the same Tables and Figures using a Shiny App created in R.
-   [Pilot
    3](https://r-consortium.org/posts/news-from-r-submissions-working-group-pilot-3/)
    delivered the Tables and Figures using R as well as the ADaMs...you
    guessed it using R. .

## Pilot 4

The R Consortium Submissions Working Group's Pilot 4 project aimed to evaluate the use of both WebAssembly and container technologies to bundle R-language based Shiny applications for submission to the FDA, focusing on enhancing reproducibility and ease of review. Pilot 4 has completed the WebAssembly portion and
we hope to have the container portion finished very soon!

### Webassembly

**Submission and Interactions:** The WebAssembly component of Pilot 4 was successfully submitted to the FDA's Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) gateway on September 20, 2024. This marked a significant milestone as it was the first publicly available submission package to include a WebAssembly component, officially received by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) staff.

**Findings and Advantages:** WebAssembly technology compiles applications into a portable and consistent environment that can be run directly within a web browser, eliminating the need for complex setups on the reviewer's side. According to Eric Nantz of Eli Lilly, using WebAssembly significantly reduces the steps reviewers need to take to get an application running on their machines.

**FDA Preference:** Surprisingly, FDA reviewers initially found WebAssembly easier to work with compared to container technology. This was contrary to the R Consortium team's initial expectation, as WebAssembly is a newer framework. Reviewers found WebAssembly more accessible because it only required a web browser, which was readily available to them.

### containers

**Submission and Interactions:** The container technology component represents the second part of the Pilot 4 project. While the WebAssembly component has been submitted, the container component was planned for submission "later this year" (referring to the announcement in October 2024). As of June 2025, a container component for Pilot 4 was still noted as "under development", although a GitHub repository for the container submission shows its eCTD bundle was last rendered on June 13, 2025, indicating progress towards its submission.

**Findings and Advantages (Expected):** The objective for containers (such as Docker or Podman) is to package the entire application environment, including system and R-specific dependencies, to ensure consistent and reproducible execution across different systems.

**FDA Interactions and Preference:** The R Consortium team initially anticipated that container technology would be easier for the FDA to administer and install. However, the initial feedback from FDA reviewers indicated a preference for the WebAssembly approach. This suggests that while containers offer robust reproducibility, their setup or execution might present an initial learning curve or more steps for FDA reviewers compared to the browser-based WebAssembly option. Additional FDA feedback on the container component is expected after its submission.

## Pilot 5

Pilot 5 is ambitious in it plans to replace all xpts with [datasetjson](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/data-exchange/dataset-json). The
pilot started in early 2025 and we were able to submit in the Fall of 2025. The ADaM
programs for Pilot 5 write out datasetjson in lieu of xpts for submission to the FDA and
we also converted all the SDTM xpts to datasetjson. The SDTM programs are not available
for this pilot and so we just did a straigtt conversion of the data using [Converting from XPT](https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson/articles/converting_files.html) from the [datasetjson R package](https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson/index.html). 

**FDA Interactions and Preference:** The FDA requested some minor rework with how we use intermediate datasets in the programs, which led to a re-submission in early 2026. We hope to have completed this
submission some time in the Spring of 2026.

**Findings and Advantages:** There are a few minor findings from conversion of data to datasetjson, which we have documented in the [ADRG](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot5-datasetjson-to-fda/blob/main/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot5/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf). We also discovered that the datasetjson v1.1 was not avaialble
in the Pinnacle 21 validation software. We discussed this with the FDA and validated
with xpts, which you can also find int he [ADRG](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot5-datasetjson-to-fda/blob/main/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot5/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf). datasetjson replacing xpts for submission
would be a huge win for modernizing workflows and stacks for doing submissions!

## Pilot 6

Each Pilot to the FDA has been focused on the delivery of the R-based content so
Pilots have been small in nature.  For example Pilot 1 only had 4 R programs! Pilot 6
seeks to expand the number of R programs availables for ADaMs and Dispalys. Pilot 6 is
not going to Submissions, but is laying the groundwork for future pilots if more
programs are needed.

## Pilot 7

## Other great achievements

### R packages submitted through ectd portal

A milestone! FDA expands accepted R file formats, resulting directly from joint work between industry and FDA through the R Consortium Submissions Working Group. Submitting an R package
via the eCTD portal just got a little easier - [Expanded FDA eCTD File Format Support for R Packages — A Milestone Achieved Through Industry–FDA Collaboration](https://r-consortium.org/posts/expanded-fda-ectd-file-format-support-for-r-packages/)

**More about the R Submissions Working Group**

The [R Consortium R Submissions Working
Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/) is focused on
improving practices for R-based clinical trial regulatory submissions.

Health authority agencies from different countries require electronic
submission of data, computer programs, and relevant documentation to
bring an experimental clinical product to market. In the past,
submissions have mainly been based on the SAS language.

In recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R
language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry and
research institutions. Although the health authorities accept
submissions based on open source programming languages, sponsors may be
hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a
lack of working examples.

Therefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims to provide R-based
submission examples and identify potential gaps while submitting these
example packages. All materials, including submission examples and
communications, are publicly available on the [R consortium GitHub
page.](https://github.com/RConsortium)

**Join the R Submissions Working Group**

The R Submissions Working Group comprises members from over 10
pharmaceutical companies, as well as regulatory agencies. We are a
collaborative community open to anyone interested in contributing to
this important work. For more information, or to get involved, visit
