The pharmaceutical industry is currently navigating a significant shift toward open-source programming, with R becoming an increasingly vital tool for regulatory submissions. In a recent R Consortium webinar, Johnson & Johnson (J\&J) shared a detailed case study of their successful "Hybrid R/SAS" submission strategy to the FDA.

Presented by Alicia Humphreys, Steven Haesendonckx, and Linshan Yuan, the presentation outlines how J\&J leveraged the strengths of both languages to achieve FDA approval, offering a roadmap for other organizations looking to modernize their submission pipelines.

### **The Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds**

Moving entirely to a new language can be daunting. J\&J adopted a pragmatic "Hybrid R/SAS" approach to balance innovation with stability:

* **SAS for Data Derivation:** ADaM datasets were created using SAS to leverage existing institutional knowledge.  
* **R for Analysis and Visualization:** All Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs) were generated using R.

This approach allowed the team to utilize R’s flexible visualization framework and cutting-edge statistical methods while seamlessly integrating into workflows built around legacy tools.

### **A Proven Success**

The presentation highlighted two major milestones regarding this strategy:

1. **Submission 1:** A pilot trial utilizing this hybrid strategy was submitted and approved by the FDA within the designed timeline.  
2. **Submission 2:** A second submission is currently ongoing with positive agency response.

### **Ensure Reproducibility**

One of the biggest hurdles in R submissions is replicating the sponsor’s environment (often Linux-based) on the reviewer’s system (often Windows).

J\&J navigated this by adapting the practices used in R consortium pilot submissions. Specifically, in Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) they included a specific Appendix titled "Set-up R environment and Analysis" which guided the reviewer through:

1. **Installation:** Using a script to install required packages from CRAN or GitHub.  
2. **Locking the Environment:** Creating an `renv.lock` file *after* installation to snapshot the ecosystem locally, rather than trying to transport a potentially non-portable lockfile between operating systems.  
3. **Execution:** Scripts were converted to `.txt` files (e.g., `tsidem01-r.txt`) to meet eCTD requirements while maintaining traceability. 

**R consortium’s Note on eCTD Requirements:** While the J\&J team converted scripts to `.txt` files for their submissions, please note that regulatory standards have recently progressed. As a result of the collaboration between the R Consortium and the FDA, the [latest FDA Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (August 2025\)](https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download?attachment) now explicitly allows R-related file extensions for electronic submissions. This conversion step is therefore no longer necessary for future eCTD packages.

### **Key Takeaways for the Community**

The presenters offered several recommendations for future R submissions:

* **Leverage Open Source Repositories:** Use CRAN or curated repositories to simplify the setup process for reviewers.  
* **Documentation and Communication are the Key:** Update the ADRG with clear instructions on package installation and environment reproduction. J\&J used the R Consortium Pilot 3 ADRG as a template. It is always a good idea to communicate with FDA staff early on your submission plan.  
* **Minimize Dependencies:** Use standard packages where possible and minimize reliance on complex proprietary packages to reduce friction.
