The useR! conference is the main international conference for users of the R programming language. This year, useR! 2025 will be held at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, on August 8-10, 2025. 

The useR! conference has been held annually since 2004, bringing together R users, developers, and enthusiasts from around the world. The conference includes keynotes, tutorials, and presentations on various applications of R in fields such as finance, pharmaceuticals, epidemiology, data science, and more.

Initially, useR! was organized in Europe, with the first event taking place in Vienna, Austria. Over the years, it has expanded to different continents, including North America, Australia, and Asia.
