As we announce the end of Joseph (Joe) Rickert’s tenure as the Executive Director of the R Consortium, we reflect on his remarkable contributions that have significantly contributed to the R community. Joe’s leadership has been instrumental in fostering growth, innovation, and collaboration within the R ecosystem.

**Founding the R Consortium**

Joe has been with the R Consortium since its inception in 2014. He was initially appointed to be Microsoft’s representative to the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) and was soon tasked with creating the R User Groups (RUGS) grants program. Joe also pioneered the formation of ISC working groups to foster industry-wide collaborative projects. In 2016, Joe was appointed to be RStudio’s representative to the Board of Directors. In 2018, he took on the role of Secretary, and by 2019, he was elected Chair of the Board. In 2023, Joe took on the role of Executive Director. Under his guidance, the R Consortium has grown into an inclusive organization supporting the R programming language and its community. Our new executive director, Terry Christiani, was affirmed by the board of directors in our August 2024 board meeting after a selection committee interviewed candidates and made recommendations.

**Advancing User Groups**

One of Joe’s notable achievements is his unwavering support for R user groups worldwide. He recognized the importance of grassroots movements in spreading the use of R and provided essential resources and funding to these groups. He was instrumental in funding the R-Ladies as a top-level ISC project that operates worldwide to provide safe places for women to come together and learn from each other in an otherwise male-dominated space. Joe was also directly involved with the Bay Area useR Group (BARUG), organizing events, speaking, or contributing to discussions around the R programming language, especially in the context of data science and statistical computing. This support has enabled countless R enthusiasts to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, thereby strengthening the global R community.

**Industry Collaboration and Working Groups**

Joe actively reached out to industry leaders to create unique working groups aimed at solving industry-wide problems. These collaborations have led to the development of working groups focused on R programming solutions that benefit not only the community but also industries that rely on data science and statistical computing.

**A Legacy of Innovation**

Throughout his tenure, Joe has been a driving force behind numerous initiatives that have propelled the R community forward. His efforts have ensured that the R Consortium remains a dynamic and inclusive organization, fostering a spirit of collaboration and innovation. His leadership has left an indelible mark on the R community, and his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of R users and developers.

As we welcome new leadership, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Joe Rickert for his dedication, vision, and tireless efforts in advancing the R community. Thank you, Joe, for your invaluable contributions and for paving the way for a brighter future for the R ecosystem.
