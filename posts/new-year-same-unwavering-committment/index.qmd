As we open our first round for [Infrastructure Steering Committee call for proposals](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/callforproposals.html) and
[R User Groups’ submissions](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/rugsprogram.html), we want to take a moment to reiterate our mission as the R Consortium.

The R Consortium promotes the growth and development of the R language and its
ecosystem by supporting technical and social infrastructure, fostering community
engagement, and driving industry adoption.

We work to ensure a thriving, diverse global R community by providing resources,
facilitating collaboration, and advocating for the use of R in multiple industry sectors.
We provide funding for technical infrastructure through grants and working groups.
We provide funding for social infrastructure through grants for R user groups and events
around the world.

We provide a neutral space where industry, academia, and government can collaborate
on mission critical processes and standards.

Our efforts in support of the R language and the community that keeps it growing and
relevant are a privilege and we are committed to ensuring that our actions are in
compliance with our code of conduct.

We hope that you and your organization will join us in support of the R language and
our community. We have a lot of work to do and we are excited to see the new and
familiar faces come together for another fantastic year.
