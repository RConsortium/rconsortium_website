# Optimizing Argentina's Public Healthcare System with R: A Case Study in Efficiency and Sustainability

In the realm of public health, the need to do more with less is a constant challenge. This is particularly true in Argentina, where the healthcare system is fragmented into three subsystems: public, social security, and private sectors. Each of these subsystems serves different populations and has its unique funding mechanisms and challenges. However, in the spirit of equity and quality healthcare access, programs like SUMAR have emerged as vital tools for supporting the uninsured population by strengthening the public subsystem. SUMAR provides financial incentives to healthcare providers for each service rendered to individuals with exclusive public coverage, funded by external sources such as the World Bank.

In this context, the Ministry of Health of the City of Buenos Aires has undertaken an innovative approach to optimize cost recovery processes via the implementation of open-source tools, particularly R, showcasing a practical application of data science in public health settings. This effort is spearheaded by the Operational Management of Health Information and Statistics, a team that uses R to enhance healthcare efficiency and sustainability.

## Understanding Argentina's Healthcare Landscape

Argentina's healthcare landscape is characterized by its division into three main sectors:

1. **Public Sector**: Comprising national, provincial, and municipal hospitals offering free universal care regardless of a person's insurance status.
2. **Social Security Sector**: Funded through payroll and catering to workers, retirees, and individuals with disabilities, providing mandatory coverage linked to formal employment.
3. **Private Sector**: Offering voluntary, prepaid plans for those seeking additional or alternative coverage.

The SUMAR program comes into play as a national policy aimed at better financing public healthcare by tying financial incentives directly to the services provided to uninsured individuals. It operates on a results-based funding model, which allocates resources based on service provision and health outcomes, with funding sourced primarily from the World Bank.

## Leveraging Technology for Sustainable Healthcare

The City of Buenos Aires is at the forefront of utilizing technology to optimize healthcare processes. The widespread adoption of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, known as the Hospital Management System (HMS), is a game-changer. HMS seamlessly integrates administrative and clinical workflows across public healthcare facilities, ensuring uniform data collection and management.

The data extracted from HMS is crucial for automating the SUMAR program. Each night, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs extract relevant data tables, such as patient encounters and diagnostics, which are then loaded into a central data warehouse. This setup forms the backbone of the automated SUMAR workflow in Buenos Aires.

## Automating the SUMAR Process with R

The automation of the SUMAR program is a testament to the power of open-source tools like R. The data science team within the Ministry of Health employs R to automate processes and generate reports, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow. Key outputs of this automated process include PDF invoices, weekly Excel reports, and performance indicator summaries.

The R-based workflow comprises three critical stages:

1. **Enrollment**: Identifying individuals with public coverage using national registries.
2. **Detection of Basic Effective Coverage Services**: Applying regex and logic rules across data sources to pinpoint eligible health services.
3. **Analysis of Health Performance Indicators**: Generating comprehensive reports through R Markdown, ensuring data is transformed into actionable insights.

The team's dedicated R environment, which includes an R Studio server and GitLab for version control, facilitates collaborative development, ensuring the process is both reproducible and auditable.

## The Impact of Automation and Open Source

The automation of the SUMAR program in Buenos Aires is not merely about efficiency—it represents a paradigm shift in how public healthcare can be managed. The steady increase in detected health services from January 2021 to April 2025 is a testament to the robustness and scalability of the automated processes. Each detected service translates into real funding, enhancing the capacity and accountability of the public healthcare system.

The use of R, with libraries like Tidyverse, StringR, WriteXL, and TinyTex, underscores the adaptability and sustainability of open-source solutions in public health. This approach not only saves time but also expands service coverage, ensuring that more individuals benefit from essential healthcare services.

## Future Directions and Opportunities

The success of the SUMAR program's automation opens up new possibilities for further innovation within the public healthcare sector. While the current focus is on generating tables and reports, there is potential for developing more interactive data visualizations and dashboards using tools like Shiny or R Markdown's interactive capabilities. Such advancements could provide deeper insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making at various levels of government.

In conclusion, the use of R in automating the SUMAR program in Buenos Aires highlights the transformative potential of data science in public health. By optimizing administrative workflows and enhancing data traceability, this initiative not only improves cost recovery efforts but also sets a benchmark for other regions to follow. As we look to the future, the continued adoption of open-source tools in healthcare promises to drive innovation and sustainability, ultimately benefiting populations most in need.
