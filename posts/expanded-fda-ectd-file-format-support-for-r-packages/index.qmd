# Expanded FDA eCTD File Format Support for R Packages — A Milestone Achieved Through Industry–FDA Collaboration

![](fda-logo.jpg)

Over the past several years, the [R Consortium Regulatory Submission Working Group](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/) has conducted multiple pilots to explore and validate the use of R in regulatory submissions. One recurring challenge surfaced early in our work:

**How should sponsors submit non-public R packages—especially those containing proprietary information—to the FDA?**

For security reasons, FDA’s eCTD portal historically allowed only a highly restricted set of file formats. As a result, standard R package formats such as compressed files were not accepted. In Pilot 1, our only feasible option was to convert an R package into a plain text bundle using [**pkglite**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkglite)—functional, but not ideal.

## **A Milestone: FDA Expands Accepted R File Formats**

### **Resulting directly from joint work between industry and FDA through the R Consortium Submissions Working Group**

We are pleased to share that the FDA has expanded its list of acceptable file formats to better support R workflows.

This update—found in the August 2025 revision of the *FDA eCTD Technical Conformance Guide* ([link to guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/85816/download?attachment))—was directly informed by multi-year collaboration between industry partners and FDA reviewers participating in the R Consortium Regulatory Submission Working Group.

Through joint pilots, repeated feedback, and hands-on testing, FDA colleagues gained deeper visibility into how R packages are used and what formats are needed to preserve functionality and reproducibility.

### **The 2025-08-20 update includes:**

**Section 9.3 – Updated references**  
 Newly accepted Modeling & Simulation file types:  
 `.rds`, `.rdb`, `.rdx`, `.rdata` / `.rda`, `.md`, `.rd` (for delivering R packages)

Expanded permissible use of:  
 `.zip` and `.html` (for delivering full R packages)

This means:

**Sponsors can now submit non-public R packages directly as a .zip file.**

This significantly reduces friction for organizations that rely on internal or proprietary R packages as part of their submission workflows.

## **Recommendation: Open-Source When Possible**

Although submitting proprietary R packages is now easier, the Working Group continues to strongly recommend that organizations **open-source their R packages whenever feasible**.

Reasons include:

**Reproducibility**  
 Public repositories (e.g., CRAN, GitHub) allow FDA reviewers and other users to retrieve, install, and verify dependencies reliably.

**Transparency in dependency handling**  
 Open-source packages minimize hidden or fragile dependency structures, supporting long-term reproducibility.

**Trust and community validation**  
 Open-source tools benefit from broader testing, feedback, and shared maintenance.

**Sustainability**  
 Packages with a public footprint are more likely to be updated and maintained over time, benefiting the entire community.

In summary, while the updated guidance provides much-needed flexibility, open-source remains the most reliable path for transparency, reproducibility, and trust.

## **Looking Ahead**

This guidance update reflects what can be achieved when industry experts and FDA reviewers work collaboratively to improve regulatory science infrastructure. The R Consortium Submissions Working Group will continue strengthening this partnership to ensure that R-based analysis workflows remain secure, reproducible, and reviewer-friendly.
