# rainbowR: Fostering an Inclusive Space for LGBTQ+ Coders in the R Community

In the vibrant and ever-evolving world of R programming, diversity and inclusion have become crucial pillars for fostering innovation and creativity. Today, we delve into the inspiring journey of rainbowR, a community dedicated to connecting, supporting, and promoting LGBTQ+ individuals who code in R. Founded seven years ago, rainbowR has grown into a thriving network with over 100 members, and it continues to champion data-driven activism and community building. Join us as we explore the origins, initiatives, and future plans of rainbowRâ€”a community that believes in the power of inclusivity to strengthen the R ecosystem.

## Speaker: Ella Kaye

Ella Kaye is a passionate advocate for diversity in the R community and a driving force behind rainbowR. Her journey began at the UseR! conference in 2017 when a chance conversation revealed the need for an LGBTQ+ community within the broader R landscape. Ella's dedication has been instrumental in shaping rainbowR into a thriving network that connects and supports LGBTQ+ individuals while promoting awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven initiatives.

## The Genesis of rainbowR

The seed for rainbowR was planted during a conversation at the UseR! conference in 2017. It was here that Ella Kaye realized the potential impact of creating a space where LGBTQ+ individuals could connect and share their experiences within the R community. The idea resonated with many, and rainbowR was born. Over the years, the community has grown and flourished, providing a supportive environment for members to engage in meaningful discussions and collaborations.

## Initiatives that Connect, Support, and Promote

rainbowR's mission is to connect, support, and promote LGBTQ+ individuals who code in R. To achieve these goals, the community has launched two main initiatives:

1. **Monthly Meetups**: Held on the fourth Wednesday of each month on Zoom, these relaxed and friendly sessions offer a platform for members to chat about R, share resources, and showcase their work. The next meetup is scheduled for June 25th, providing an opportunity for participants to engage in a supportive setting.

2. **Buddy Scheme**: Designed to foster deeper connections, this initiative randomly pairs members every three months. Participants fill out a form detailing their interests, and an R script generates pairings and sends introduction emails. This approach helps members overcome the nerves of meeting new people and encourages meaningful conversations.

## Data-Driven Activism and Community Engagement

rainbowR is committed to data-driven activism, hosting a GitHub repository called Tidy Rainbow that features LGBTQ+ datasets. These datasets serve as valuable resources for practicing data visualization, analysis, and teaching. The community also recently concluded its first rainbowR book club, where participants discussed "Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex, and Sexuality Data for Action" by Kevin Gian. The success of this initiative has paved the way for future book clubs.

## Growing the Community and Future Plans

The past year has been transformative for rainbowR, with the community doubling in size. Ella Kaye's efforts, including speaking engagements at conferences such as UseR! in Salzburg and Posit, have played a pivotal role in this growth. Social media strategies on platforms like Blue Sky and Mastodon have further amplified rainbowR's reach.

Looking ahead, Ella's fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute will support plans to nurture and sustain rainbowR. This includes ensuring clear pathways for community engagement, establishing robust policies and governance, and becoming a legal entity. A flagship event, the first-ever rainbowR Conference, will bring the community together to learn and share best practices in R and software sustainability.
