It's official: the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) has opened the second grant cycle of 2025 today, September 1, 2025. If you've ever thought, *"I have an idea that could make life better for R users everywhere"*, this is your chance.

## **What the ISC Is Looking For**

The ISC focuses projects that deliver practical impact for the R community:

* **Tools and packages** that smooth workflows and make R more powerful.  
* **Education resources** like documentation, tutorials, reproducible workflows.  
* **Infrastructure** that connects people, supports open science, or broadens access.

The sweet spot? Proposals that are clear, scoped, and realistic. Don't over-promiseâ€”break down big ideas into digestible, doable steps. 

High-risk, high-reward moonshots aren't the target here. ISC grants back low-to-medium-risk projects with clear deliverables. A bit of work done alreadyâ€”sketches, prototypes, draftsâ€”shows you're ready to go.

## **What's Not Covered**

Just so you don't waste your time: events, conferences, and meetups belong under the [**RUGS funding program**](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/rugsprogram.html), not this one. ISC grants are for infrastructure and technical or social projects that scale across the community.

---

## **How to Apply**

1. Download and use the ISC proposal template.  
2. Build your submission as a single PDFâ€”self-contained and clear.  
3. Submit it through the Google Form (yes, you'll need a Google account).  
4. Look for a confirmation email with a subject *"Thank you for your proposal!"*â€”and check spam if you don't see it.

Bonus tip: Read the ISC's standard agreement now so you're not surprised later.

## **Why Bother? Because This Is Big**

This is one of only **two ISC grant windows per year**. Grants get paid in two chunksâ€”half when you sign, half when you finishâ€”so you know you'll be supported from the start through the finish line.

Over the past few years, ISC grants have funded projects that strengthened core R tools, expanded internationalization, improved documentation, and built bridges across the ecosystem. It's not just about moneyâ€”it's about visibility, credibility, and lasting community impact.

When you're funded, your work gets showcased to the global R community. You're not just solving your own problemâ€”you're leveling up tools and workflows for thousands of R users worldwide.

## **Time to Jump In**

If you've been tinkering on a package, sketching a new teaching resource, thinking of ways to make R more inclusive, or dreaming of infrastructure that smooths collaborationâ€”this is your launchpad.

Don't hold back. Share your idea, shape it into a proposal, and send it in.

**Submissions close October 1.**

Your idea could be the one that pushes the R ecosystem forward!
