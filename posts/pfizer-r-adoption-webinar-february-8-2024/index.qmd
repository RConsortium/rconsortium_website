## Pfizer’s Progressive Shift to R:

At the heart of Pfizer’s data analysis revolution is the adoption of R – a language known for its robust community-driven development and open-source nature. This move is not just about changing tools; it’s about embracing a culture of innovation and collaboration.

The journey began with an internal query at Pfizer: How many of our colleagues are proficient in R? The answer led to the unveiling of a latent community of R users, eager yet unconnected. In 2022, an internal survey highlighted the presence of over 1,500 R users, a clear sign of a burgeoning community within Pfizer.

In response, Pfizer established the R Center of Excellence (CoE) in 2022. This initiative marked a shift from scattered individual efforts to a cohesive, strategic approach to R adoption. The CoE, celebrating its first anniversary in 2023, has become a linchpin in nurturing Pfizer’s vibrant R community.
