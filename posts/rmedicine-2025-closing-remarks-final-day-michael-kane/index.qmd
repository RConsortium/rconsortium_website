# Closing Remarks from R/Medicine 2025 by Michael Kane, MD

As R/Medicine 2025 concludes its second and final day, Michael Kane, MD, from the Anderson Cancer Center, delivered the closing remarks, encapsulating the essence and future direction of this unique conference dedicated to the intersection of R programming and healthcare. Kane, a co-founder of R/Medicine, provided insights into the conference's achievements and aspirations, leaving the audience with a sense of community and purpose.

## Acknowledgments

Kane began by expressing gratitude to the organizing committee, with a special nod to Emily Zaber, who chaired this year's event. The seamless execution of the conference, he noted, is a testament to the dedication and behind-the-scenes effort of the team. The importance of organization and meticulous planning cannot be overstated, and this year's smooth proceedings are a reflection of such diligence.

## A Conference for the Community

Emphasizing the core philosophy of R/Medicine, Kane reiterated that this conference is designed to be a platform for the community. The healthcare space is expansive, with myriad groups engaged in cutting-edge research that often goes underrepresented. R/Medicine aims to bridge this gap by providing a forum for practitioners and methodologists alike to share their work, explore collaborative opportunities, and contribute to ongoing projects.

The conference's commitment to inclusivity was evident in the diverse international participation this year. Attendees from South America, Europe, and other regions enriched the discussions with their unique perspectives and innovations. This global engagement underscores the universal applicability and potential of R in transforming healthcare.

## Towards a Continuous Engagement

Looking ahead, Kane shared the committee's vision of making R/Medicine a continuous engagement rather than a once-a-year event. The introduction of periodic webinars is a step in this direction, allowing for ongoing dialogue and knowledge exchange throughout the year. By maintaining a steady flow of information and interaction, R/Medicine seeks to foster a vibrant and dynamic community that stays connected and informed about the latest developments in healthcare.

## Invitation to Participate

In closing, Kane extended an open invitation to all participants to become more involved in R/Medicine. Whether by submitting proposals for future conferences, contributing to ongoing projects, or joining the organizing committee, the opportunities for involvement are numerous. The committee is keen on remaining dynamic and responsive to emerging healthcare challenges, and fresh perspectives are always welcome.

Kane's remarks concluded with heartfelt thanks to all attendees and participants, with a promise of even more exciting developments in the coming year. As R/Medicine 2025 draws to a close, the community looks forward to another year of innovation, collaboration, and progress in using R to revolutionize healthcare.
