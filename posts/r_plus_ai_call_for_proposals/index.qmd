### Call for Proposals

Join us at **R+AI 2025**, our inaugural conference dedicated to the open-source R community and every facet of artificial intelligence. Whether you’re just getting started with machine learning, experimenting with large language models in R, leveraging GenAI tools to accelerate your code, part of an industry team deploying AI solutions in finance, healthcare, or marketing, or a researcher pushing the boundaries of deep learning or responsible AI—there’s something here for you. Experience inspiring keynotes and talks, hands-on workshops, lightning talks, and panel discussions designed to educate, connect, and empower R users at every level.

#### [Submit your proposal here](https://forms.gle/SUbQVNMpp11g7vbTA)

## CFP dates: OPEN 7/10/2025 \- CLOSES: 09/05/2025

We are now inviting proposals for talks and workshops in all these areas:

    "**Foundations of AI & ML in R**<br>Tutorials and primers that help R users grasp core concepts, algorithms, and the modern R toolchain for GenAI, machine learning and deep learning.",
    "**Using large-language models inside R**<br>E.g., packages and tools that help you call LLMs from R, prompt engineering for data science, how LLM conversations work.",
    "**AI-assisted Development for R**<br>E.g., techniques and tools, Shiny Assistant, RStudio plug ins, comparison of different model capabilities.",
    "**Machine learning & Deep Learning in R**<br>Education about popular R packages, workflows and toolchains, what sorts of problems they apply to, how and when to use them. Introduction to new R packages or algorithms.",
    "**Industry Case Studies: R+AI in Action**<br>Applications of GenAI, ML and DL using R across Finance, healthcare, marketing, manufacturing, research labs, and more—real-world success stories and lessons learned.",
    "**Responsible, Fair & Explainable AI + Governance with R**<br>Model interpretability, reproducibility, bias detection, privacy-preserving ML, governance and ethics for the use of R+AI.",
    "**AIOps/MLOps & Production Deployment with R**<br>Frameworks, toolchains and techniques for putting AI/ML into production. Case studies on successful deployments and lessons learned are also welcome.",
    "**Future Trends & Research Frontiers for R+AI**<br>E.g., Emerging Models & Architectures, Auto-Data Science, Low-Code AI—from the R user’s or developer’s perspective.",
