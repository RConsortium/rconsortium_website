| Pilot 3 submission</br></br>The R Consortium is pleased to announce that on August 28, 2023, the R Submissions Working Group successfully submitted an R-based test submission pilot 3 package through the FDA eCTD gateway! </br></br>The pilot 3 test submission is an example of an all R submission package following eCTD specifications. These include the installation and loading of the proprietary {pilot3} R package and other open-source R packages, R scripts for the analysis data model (ADaM) datasets from pilot 3 and tables, listings, figures (TLFs) from pilot 1, analysis data reviewerâ€™s guide (adrg), and other required eCTD components. The working group also began working on a pilot 4 project to explore the use of novel technologies such as Linux containers and WebAssembly software to bundle a Shiny application into a self-contained package in order to facilitate a smoother process for transferring and executing the application. Stay tuned for more about pilot 4 in the future.</br></br>[https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/09/11/first-publicly-available-r-based-submission-package-submitted-to-fda-pilot-3](https://www.r-consortium.org/announcement/2023/09/11/first-publicly-available-r-based-submission-package-submitted-to-fda-pilot-3)  | Ning Leng:</br> [lengn@genecom](#lengn@genecom) </br>Joseph Rickert:</br> [joseph.rickert@gmail.com](joseph.rickert@gmail.com)</br>Further information:</br> [https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg)   |
