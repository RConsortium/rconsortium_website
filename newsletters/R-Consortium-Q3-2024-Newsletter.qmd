# R Consortium Q3 2024 Newsletter

Welcome to the R Consortium's Q3 2024 Newsletter! 

This quarter has been packed with exciting updates, innovative projects, and global 
community initiatives that are shaping the future of R. 

Big news! The R Submissions Working Group successfully completed the “Pilot 3 Submission” 
which is testing the concept that an R-language based submission package for ADaMs and TLFs 
can meet the needs and the expectations of the FDA reviewers, including assessing code review 
and analyzing reproducibility. This is great progress! See the Submissions Working Group section 
below for more details.

And there’s more! From the appointment of our new Executive Director, Terry Christiani, to the 
launch of our new Quarto website there's a lot to dive into! 

We’ve also seen impressive progress in our technical working groups, and we continue to support 
R User Groups across the globe. 

Whether you're interested in the latest package developments, upcoming webinars, or community 
stories, there's something here for everyone. 

Let's explore what's new in the R world!

## New Executive Director 

We are excited to announce that Terry Christiani has been appointed as the new Executive Director 
of the R Consortium! The board of directors affirmed Terry’s selection during our August 2024 
board meeting, following a thorough process in which a dedicated selection committee interviewed 
candidates and provided recommendations. We look forward to Terry’s leadership in guiding the R 
Consortium’s initiatives and supporting the global R community.

“I have been involved in supporting the R language and its users for many years and am so excited 
to have the opportunity to work with the R Consortium. The consortium is supporting important work 
across multiple industries. I hope to ensure that we continue to build on past successes and create 
more opportunities for R users to deliver valuable insights and analyses for their organizations.” 

—Terry Christiani, Executive Director, R Consortium 


## New R Consortium Quarto Website

The R Consortium has a new website based on Quarto, the open source technical publishing system. 
Quarto allows easy embedding of R code examples as well as R-based interactive charts. Most of the 
R community already publishes documents in Quarto, making it easier to 
[accept community contributions](https://r-consortium.org/blog/guidelines.html) for blogs and 
technical documents. 

The URL is the same: www.r-consortium.org. The older site is archived at archive.r-consortium.org.


## Building Extended R Packages to Improve R Infrastructure

A major goal of the R Consortium is to strengthen and improve the infrastructure supporting the R 
ecosystem. We seek to accomplish this by funding projects that will improve the technical infrastructure of R. 

There are [two open application grant cycles each year](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/callforproposals.html). The 
latest round of the R Consortium's Call for Proposals officially ended on October 1st, 2024. 

We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who submitted proposals. Each submission plays a pivotal 
role in strengthening the R ecosystem, and we are thrilled to see such innovative ideas pour in.

As we eagerly anticipate the announcement of the newly funded projects, we reflect on our mission to 
support and enhance the technical infrastructure behind R. Past initiatives have made significant 
contributions, including:

* [Testing DBI](https://github.com/rstats-db/DBItest) and improving key open-source database backends
* Enhancements to critical packages such as [mapview](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview) and [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
* Improving R translations to expand accessibility
* Continued infrastructure development for R on Windows and macOS

Stay tuned for the upcoming announcement of the new projects that will continue to drive the evolution 
of R’s technical foundation!

# Technical Projects and Working Groups

ISC working groups provide the mechanism through which the ISC can explore, fund, and manage large 
collaborative projects. Working groups are vetted by R Consortium experts and sanctioned by the R 
Consortium. They become visible to the greater R Community, and in many cases are an excellent vehicle 
for industry to connect directly to R development. 

Here  are some updates from our current Working Groups.

## Submissions Working Group

### Pilot 3 complete!

The R Consortium is pleased to announce [the successful completion of the Pilot 3 Submission](https://r-consortium.org/posts/news-from-r-submissions-working-group-pilot-3/) which 
extended the work done in Pilots 1 and 2 by generating the ADaM datasets. The complete 
[FDA response letter](https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/blob/main/_Documents/Summary_R_Pilot3_Submission.pdf) is available here.

The objective of the R Consortium R Submission Pilot 3 Project is to test the concept that an 
R-language based submission package for ADaMs and TLFs can meet the needs and the expectations 
of the FDA reviewers, including assessing code review and analyzing reproducibility. All submission 
materials and communications from this pilot are publicly available, with the aim of providing a 
working example for future R-language based FDA submissions. This is an FDA-industry collaboration 
through the non-profit organization R Consortium.

A pilot 3 overview presentation during the 2024 R/medicine conference is available on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krcy3gSfDzs).


### Pilot 4 submission on Sept 20

As a next step, the R Consortium R Submission Working Group initiated [submission pilot 4](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot4/), to 
explore the use of novel technologies such as Linux containers and web assembly to bundle a 
Shiny application into a self-contained package, facilitating a smoother process of both 
transferring and executing the application. 

Pilot 4 is being cited in a recent [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00725-1) (paywall).


## Census Working Group 

The [U.S. Census Bureau](https://census.gov/en.html) is the premier source of data about America's 
people, places and economy. This makes the Bureau a natural source of information for data analysts. 
R programmers who start working with Census Data, however, often run into two problems:

1. Understanding what data the Census Bureau publishes.
2. Understanding what packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) are available to help with their project.

The Census working group released a second version of their guide “A Guide to Working with Census Data 
in R.” The guide aims to help R programmers who are confronted with these problems. Check out the full 
guide here: [https://github.com/RConsortium/censusguide](https://github.com/RConsortium/censusguide).

Key updates include: 

* Revamped the section on Data Dissemination to remove reference to the (now deprecated) American Fact 
Finder and instead point people to the (new) [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/). 
* New to working with the Census API? Check out the tutorials and resources linked in the API section 
to learn more and get started.
* Updated the list of R packages listed in the guide to reflect not just new download stats but also 
new packages published since the initial version. 
* Expanded the list of programs and datasets Census provides, including links to learn more about them.

Our working group welcomes feedback! We are still working on adding tutorials and other package/training 
related resources to the guide, so readers have more to look forward to with the next update.

## Marshaling and Serialization in R

The R Consortium ISC Working Group on Marshaling and Serialization in R started in May 2024. This working 
group aims at developing standard practices for marshaling and unmarshaling of R objects. 

This will involve identifying current problems, raising awareness, and coming up with technical solutions. 
This may require additions to base R. For example, one solution *might* be to introduce support for 
`serialize()` and `unserialize()` to call registered hook functions whenever certain types of objects 
are encountered, which then could marshall and unmarshall those objects.

More information can be found here: [https://github.com/RConsortium/marshalling-wg](https://github.com/RConsortium/marshalling-wg)


## Multilingual R Documentation

The Multilingual R Documentation working group started in June 2024. There was a virtual meeting to set 
the stage, and in person meetings during [R Dev Day @ PLUS](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-day-plus-2024/). Its 
lead presented the project at useR! 2024. 

We have a working package and ideas for improvement. There's a few PRs from collaborators under review and 
even an example of real world use of the package: a [French translation of the torchvision documentation](https://github.com/cregouby/torchvision.fr). We 
have [this repository](https://github.com/RConsortium/multilingual-documentation-wg?tab=readme-ov-file) and a 
channel in the [R Consortium Slack](https://rconsortium.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC075V1SUKT9%3Fname%3DC075V1SUKT9) that anyone 
is welcome to join to participate. 

## R7 Package - Design refining

The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) working group continues to refine the design and functionality of 
the package through active discussions within the group and the community at large. 

The long-term goal of this project is to merge S7 in to base R. For now, you can experiment by 
installing it from CRAN:

```
install.packages("S7")
```

## R Validation Hub

The R Validation Hub is a collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical 
regulatory setting.

The R Validation Hub  enhanced their website this summer to improve navigation. Please take some 
time to check it out and send feedback: [https://www.pharmar.org/](https://www.pharmar.org/) 

The R Validation solutions for the validation of R packages quantify the “risk” of R packages 
with several metrics {riskmetric} and provide a user-friendly, full-fledged R Shiny app as a 
central hub to gauge the “risk” of packages {riskassessment}.

For {riskassessment} the R Validation Hub is announcing the release of two new features: 

* Automate "risk decisions" based on {riskmetric} quality assessment values. 
* New module called the “Function Explorer” which allows users to explore any function 
exported from a package in one easy-to-use interface.

Special thanks to Glaxo-Smith Kline (GSK) contributors for donating this code!

For more details about our new features, read our blog post: 
[https://www.pharmar.org/posts/news/updates-aug-2024/](https://www.pharmar.org/posts/news/updates-aug-2024/)  

From the R Validation Hub:

“Our roadmap for the app is going scoreless. Most organizations don't really make actionable 
decisions from {riskmetric}'s overall package score. It can sometimes deter our attention from 
the more meaningful quality metrics or even lead to unnecessary confusion or bias. As such, 
we want Admin users to make the decision whether they want this quantitative metric to be 
displayed in the app at all. Stay tuned!”

### Collecting regulatory package lists

We’ve asked a few pharmaceutical organizations what R Packages have qualified for late stage 
analysis. We were encouraged by the transparent effort companies like Roche made: 
[https://insightsengineering.github.io/rvalidationhub-packages/](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rvalidationhub-packages/)


### Reg R Repo: first pilot released 

The [Regulatory R Repository](https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg) working group 
released its first pilot this summer, a repository of R packages with pre-calculated risk 
metrics: [https://github.com/pharmaR/pharmapkgs](https://github.com/pharmaR/pharmapkgs)

We are working on a second release with more advanced features: risk metrics calculated on a 
container image and the generation of a validation report for each R package on the repository. 

# R Consortium Webinars
